I'm a registered speaker with (and, since 2021, president of) the Children's Writers & Illustrators of British Columbia (CWILL BC) Society, and a member of The Writers Union of Canada, the Canadian Science Fiction & Fantasy Association, and the Comox Valley Writers' Society, among others.
</p>
	<p>
In addition to <a href="https://kaie.space/about.html#events" target="_blank;" alt="K.A. Wiggins About page events subsection">a wide variety of international event speaking</a>, public education, and corporate training experience, I have taught seasonal camps and term-length intensive workshops on creativity, storytelling, publishing, and writing themes for kids in grades 3-5, grades 5-7, teens, and adults with the Creative Writing for Children Society for the past several years. Many CWC workshops involve producing a group anthology or individual "novels" (multi-chapter, perfect-bound paperbacks.)
</p>
			<p>
I <em>love</em> teaching—call it a passion for books, a joy of sharing knowledge, or neurodivergent info-dumping!—but my goal is for every person who learns with me to be informed, inspired, and empowered to make something weird and wonderful of their own. Every talk or workshop is as much an interactive performance piece as a presentation, responsive to the needs of whoever's in the room.
</p>
	</div>
</div>
	<p>
While I'm all about frank conversations when it comes to the industry and the challenges of artistic practice, I believe every artist is different and needs freedom to find their own voice. Harsh feedback is the enemy of creativity. I respect my audiences, whether they're six or sixty, sharing as openly as I know how.
</p>
	<p>
Finally, I write horror, and fantasy, and science fiction—always happy to talk monsters and magic, whether rooted in the everyday evils we face, or fully exploring the fantastical possibilites of fiction. Ask me about genre-specific offerings for your themed/seasonal event or festival!

	Logistics
	</h2>
<p>
While I <em>can</em> do "author readings," I enjoy collaborating with you to identify the best topics for your needs and audience and would love to offer a presentation or workshop that directly engages attendees in creativity and learning. (Though I can certainly suggest topics that have worked well in the past, depending on age and subject.) 
</p><p>
Climate futurism, fighting the patriarchy, ghosts of the past, and horror-meets-humour are popular "broad-interest" topics for general (non-writing) groups, while creative writing or ELA bookings may focus more on paths to publishing, worldbuilding, descriptive writing, etc. Smaller (/younger?) groups may also benefit from integrated or extension activities such as crafts, multimodal learning, etc. (see examples in the gallery below!)
</p><p>
Two of my most popular bookings are:
</p>
<h4 id="improv">
	Interactive (Whiteboard) Storytelling/Story-building Improv
</h4>
<p>
Starts with a brief intro (who I am, what I write), followed by Q&A (depending on time and interest), and a guided large group exercise that springboards off of the three-act/four-part basic story structure used across much of contemporary (Western) media and explores character, setting, plot (goal/motivation/conflict) and the five key turning points in a light-weight and portable, rapid-fire (and usually extremely funny) format that can be scaled to any age group and skill/interest level.
</p>
<p>
	Often irreverent and unexpectedly engaging for the "reluctant writers" in the group. Can be followed up by small group exercises in guided workshops (for half-day or longer bookings) or take-away worksheets and lesson plans for use in classrooms and clubs. Possible in very large settings (whole school/auditorium) with guided support (helpers in the crowd to gather and relay comments, possibly using portable mics), but better with a small enough group that participants feel comfortable calling out ideas on their own (works with groups 3-80+ and ages 5-adult)
</p>
<h4 id="senses">
	Writing the Senses
	</h4>
<p>
	Best for smaller groups (single classroom or smaller), or with significant planning/prep and adult helpers' support for logistics. Contemporary Western cultures are very visual (blame TV?) and young/emerging writers in particular often struggle to bring their stories to life using all the senses.
</p><p>
	This booking can be a made as a single visit (using stations for each sense and adult helpers or work-at-your-own pace instructions) or over a longer period(afternoon/day, week/camp, series of weeks/author residency, etc.) to zero in on each sense individually. 
	</p><p>
		Scales for size/age/ability, but the general format is multimedia-oriented, so participants will have a (or a range of, depending on time) "blind box" of objects to engage with for the "touch" portion, for instance, recordings for the audio portion, etc. Scaffolding and extension activities can be incorporated or discussed as part of institutional engagement with the booking. Can be naturalistic/literal or fantastical (sometimes I do these workshops around Halloween with a "Monster's Feast" theme!) Again, this works great for small kids, teens, even adults, with some adjustment.
</p><p>
<h2 id="read">
	Author Readings
	</h2>
	<p>
	While I've <em>written</em> for nearly all ages, I am not (yet) published in every age/grade level that I provide workshops/presentations for, so although I can read from works in progress if necessary, I make a point of drawing on other BC/Canadian kids' books to fill that gap for younger audiences in particular.
	</p><p>	
For example, I like to use the fantastically funny <em>The Weird Sisters' Detective Agency</em> by Metro-Vancouver-based Mark David Smith and Kari Rust when I do that descriptive writing workshop on building sensory writing skills for a grade school audience. Victoria-area author Leslie Gentile's <em>Shamus, the Urban Rez Dog PI</em> is a great companion/reference book for slightly older readers to practice similar skills (smell, taste, touch), etc.
</p><p>
Likewise, when speaking to adults, I bring my experience working with over 150 (and growing) authors and illustrators publishing across a wide range of experiences from entrepreneurial indies to top-flight Big 5 (plus Arts Society executive boards and creative education experiences) to share tips, trends, and best practices, as well as my individual experience in writing, publishing, leadership and creative education to bear as appropriate.
</p><p>
While I tend to find that, in most cases, institutions and students are getting more out of interactive learning experiences oriented around how they can exercise creativity, if there is a strong preference for an actual author reading during a booking, please do mention that and I can can certainly prepare something from my own work or a BC author's, as needed.
</p>
	<h2 id="fees">
	Schedule & Fees
	</h2>
	<p>
Please enquire regarding dates, fees, and any other pertinent logistics with as much notice as possible—my schedule does book up!
</p><p>
Fees are generally <a href="https://www.cwillbc.org/tips.htm" target="_blank">in line with local/national standards as set by The Writers Union of Canada and children's writers</a>, (as of 2025, classroom visits and/or roughly hour-long programming are booking in the $300-350 range for both in-person and virtual events, travel outside of the home region extra) but may be subject to adjustment based on the specific event parameters.
</p><p>
Nonprofits should enquire about discounts or alternate arrangements if budget is a barrier. Assistance with grant and funding applications may be available. As a member of The Writer's Union of Canada, you can seek funding under their programs to work with me, including the Ontario Writers-In-The-Schools and the National Public Readings programs. BC-based schools can also seek funding through ArtStarts—happy to collaborate on applications for extended creative workshop or artist-in-schools residencies, to make sure our local kids get access to those opportunities! 
</p><p>
Home base is Courtenay, BC. The nearest airport is Comox (YQQ) or Vancouver (YVR) for international flights. Ground travel to mainland BC or other PNW locations may also be possible with enough notice. Day trip bookings on Vancouver Island that do not require an overnight stay or ferry will not incur travel/transit surcharges. Zoom/virtual/remote presentations are available.

	Testimonials
	</h2>
<p>
"Kaie recently joined our Guild of Young Writers program for a virtual Speculative Fiction workshop that exceeded all of our expectations! Kaie provided such an insightful presentation, sharing her own writing process and tidbits about the business of writing itself before diving deep into the elements of speculative fiction.
</p><p>
Her presentation was interactive and engaged the students with specific tips and examples from her own writing, along with suggestions to bring back to their own writing practice. She answered all of their questions with thoughtful and knowledgeable responses and provided the students with such inspiration to move forth with their own writing projects."

	This might not look super impressive, but it's enormously fun for everyone involved and also pretty impressive on the kids' part (they're only G3-5).
</p><p>
We did the exercise together periodically over the first several weeks, with me sorting and running votes on the various wacky ideas they'd call out, then sketching the results along the chart and pointing out how it all fits into the key turning points and story arc, guiding what kind of ideas we'd need for the next stage of the story, etc.
</p><p>
Then, about half-way through the term, they switched to working in (rotating) small groups, making their own. 
</p><p>
<em>Important tip for educators trying this in the classroom: DO NOT shut down ideas hard, or they'll dry up! Keep it fun and fast-paced. Loosen the reins on classroom rules a little.
</em></p><p><em>
Some kids WILL try you, but they're also often the ones who are normally disengaged, so you don't want to miss the chance to reengage them. Consider channelling/deflecting ideas that truly violate acceptable school behaviour ("hmm, not sure that will work, how about . . . ") rather than a hard "no" and also consider accepting (/softening the edges of) some ideas that would normally not be acceptable.
</em></p><p><em>
(Anecdotally, I see educators shut down story ideas with violence or, uh, gross/rude stuff, ALL THE TIME in the classroom, and nearly every boy's attention switches right off when it happens (resulting in distracting behaviours soon after). I understand the need for classroom discipline and trauma-informed teaching, but mostly letting them practice their storytelling skills by injecting potty humour or blowing up imaginary cities is </em>not<em> cultivating homicidal sociopaths, it's just . . . developing their creative muscles—and potentially therapeutic.) 
</em></p><p><em>
This (IMHO) is one of the reasons it can be really helpful to bring in a creative to the classroom who can kind of bring that separate space for free and safe creativity with them. It can also be less confusing for you and the kids to navigate . . .
