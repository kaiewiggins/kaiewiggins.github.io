		    Experience:
	</h4>
	<p>
		I publish <a href="https://kaie.space/about.html#awards" target="_blank;" alt="K.A. Wiggins About page awards and accolades subsection">award-winning, best-in-Canada</a> speculative fiction (fantasy, science fiction & horror) of all lengths (flash fiction through to novels/series!) for kids, teens and adult readers, and have <a href="https://kaie.space/about.html#events" target="_blank;" alt="K.A. Wiggins About page events subsection">extensive experience</a> in workshops and public speaking for elementary, middle school/junior high, high school, and adult audiences.
	</p>
	<p>
I'm a registered speaker with (and, since 2021, president of) the Children's Writers & Illustrators of British Columbia (CWILL BC) Society, and a member of The Writers Union of Canada, the Canadian Science Fiction & Fantasy Association, and the Comox Valley Writers' Society, among others.
</p>
	<p>
In addition to <a href="https://kaie.space/about.html#events" target="_blank;" alt="K.A. Wiggins About page events subsection">a wide variety of international event speaking</a>, public education, and corporate training experience, I have worked with the Creative Writing for Children Society for the past several years, and have extensive experience creating curriculum and facilitating seasonal camps and term-length intensive workshops on creativity, storytelling, publishing, and writing themes for kids in grades 3-5, grades 5-7, teens, and adults. Many CWC workshops involve producing a group anthology or individual "novels" (multi-chapter, perfect-bound paperbacks.)
</p>
	<p>
I <em>love</em> teaching—call it a passion for books, a joy of sharing knowledge, or neurodivergent info-dumping!—but my goal is for every person who learns with me to be informed, inspired, and empowered to make something weird and wonderful with whatever they've learned. Every talk or workshop is as much an interactive performance piece as a presentation, responsive to the needs of whoever's in the room.
</p>
	<p>
And while I'm all about frank conversations when it comes to the industry and the various challenges of creating art, I believe every artist is different and needs freedom to find their own voice. Harsh feedback is the enemy of creativity. I respect my audiences, whether they're six or sixty, sharing as openly as I know how.
</p>
	<p>
Finally, I write horror, and fantasy, and science fiction—and I'm always happy to talk monsters and magic, whether the everyday evils we face, or the fantastical possibilites of fiction. Ask me about genre-specific options for your themed or seasonal event or festival!
