			    <p class="lead">In the Towers of Refuge, regulation dictates every aspect of life.
			    </p>
<p>Haunted 17-year-old Cole would do anything to shake her reputation as a failure. The only way to survive the nightmarish Mara is absolute obedience, and she’s down to her last chance. 
			    </p>
<p>But when a charismatic stranger shows up claiming to know her and Cole discovers Refuge's absolute control and guarantee of safety are both illusions, she realizes hers isn’t the only life at stake and goes on the run.
			    </p>
			    <p class="lead">In the underground club Freedom, nothing’s forbidden.
			    </p>
<p>Cole needs allies to help her expose Refuge’s lies and escape execution by nightmare. Too bad the only candidates are a hedonistic rebel, a childish ghost, a stylist with a secret and an imaginary friend with a talent for monster-hunting.
			    </p>
<p>With enforcers in pursuit and the dead invading her dreams, Cole must figure out who to trust and stop the dying before the nightmares eat her alive.
			    </p>
<p class="text-muted">Trusted authorities lie, allies have their own agendas and even the monsters wear masks in this YA dark fantasy suitable for ages 14 and up.
