Considering tandem-writing 2 or more books… Clearly I don’t ‘write’ full time, but I don’t seem to do much else that’s productive with all the not-writing time. 

Well, not productive in an employable, income-earning sense. Lotta research… 

I wonder if I could work at a historic site or museum? Two birds one stone? 

Anyways, all my efficient future-forward schemes like freelancing, learning coding etc. seem to just distract and take away from writing, so what if I could get more productive writing time out of myself (reaching here, I know!) by switching stories? 

But by that argument, couldn’t I just get the same effect by switching perspectives and sections (hint: apparently not.) Something to work on… 

Debating between fantasy/historical fic for the next project and teen/adult vs. kids/YA target audience.
