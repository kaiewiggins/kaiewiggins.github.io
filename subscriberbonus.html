     <h4>Not sure what file type you need?</h4>
  <ul>
<li>.epub ebook files work great with ereaders and reading apps like iBooks on computers and mobile devices.</li>
 <li>.pdf is a standard file type that works on pretty much all devices including computers and within mobile apps, but it's just not as pretty... :/ </li>
 <li>.mobi is for Kindle devices and apps ONLY. Use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email">this guide</a> to load .mobi files to your Kindle ereader or app.</li>
 <li>.m4b is the audiobook file type. It's a single file with content built in, like chapter breaks and cover art. It works with many audio players such as iTunes.</a></li>
 <li>...but if you prefer, the audiobook is also available packaged in a ZIP file. It works like a CD album with multiple tracks. You download the file, open it to view the files, and then each audiobook chapter is a separate .mp3 (common audio format) that you can open in an audio player and listen to like any music file.</li>
