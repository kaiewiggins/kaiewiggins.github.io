						 <h3>On the Edge</h3>
						 <br />
<p>NA horror/dark fantasy faery story about walking on water, adulthood & escaping reality in the Scottish Highlands.
						 </p>
						 <p>Inspired by adventures in the UK, this story licensed first digital rights to <a href="https://enchantedconversationmag.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Enchanted Conversation Magazine</a> in June 2019 and they've kindly <strong>posted the full text online so you can read it for free</strong>.
						 </p>
<p>It has my (and readers', apparently) favourite ending to date and comments include: "exceptional and lyrically beautiful" and "It's got the spooky, fair folk vibes that I live for; the atmosphere really just shines in this."

						 <h3>The Unsought Light</h3>
						 <br />
<p>Promised from birth to the son of the clan lord, Hana's only joy is gazing out over the lake beyond her window.
						 </p>
						 <p>She dreams of floating away on the breeze like the cherry blossoms, but when an otherworldly stranger offers a chance at escape, duty and desire collide in a war that threatens to bring down her family, her clan, and her village.
</p>
<p><strong>Freedom. Passion. Family. Fate. What do you do when there are no good choices left?</strong>
</p>
<p>A gothic retelling of the ancient Japanese folktale The Maiden of Unai, this short story explores the untold perspective of the "maiden" destined for an arranged political marriage in a time and place where family fortunes mattered more than individual happiness or choice. A historical romance in the vein of Rome & Juliet with a supernatural twist.
