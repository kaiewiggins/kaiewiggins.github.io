						 <h3>The Unsought Light</h3>
						 <br />
<p>Hana dreams of floating away on the breeze like the cherry blossoms, but when an otherworldly stranger offers a chance at escape from the stifling bonds of her impending arranged marriage to the son of the clan lord, duty and desire collide in a war that threatens to bring down her family, her clan, and her village.
</p>
<p><strong>Freedom. Passion. Family. Fate. What do you do when there are no good choices left?</strong>
</p>
<p>A gothic retelling of the ancient Japanese folktale The Maiden of Unai, this short story explores the untold perspective of the "maiden" destined for an arranged political marriage in a time and place where family fortunes mattered more than individual happiness or choice. A historical tragic romance in the vein of Rome & Juliet with a supernatural twist.
