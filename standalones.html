						 <p><strong>Don't call her a ghost. And she's sure no angel. She's not sure what she is—besides lost. But when you flatline, she’ll be there. Fighting to send you back.</strong>
						 </p>
<p>Sancta Faustina doesn't know why she's summoned to the side of the many victims of Vancouver's toxic drug crisis. Maybe it has something to do with the way she lived. Maybe it has something to do with the way she died. All she knows is there's yet another body cooling on the ground, a blitzed spirit bobbing halfway through the ceiling, and a foolishly loyal pup depending on her to <em>fix it</em> from the wrong side of the veil . . .

							 <li>Longlisted in the 2024 Commonwealth Short Story Prize</li>
							 <li>Semi-Finalist in the 2023 Writers of the Future Awards</li>
							 <li>"Heartrending! And excellent use of F-bombs."—Reader</li>
							 <li>"The story and the character were incredibly likable and powerful. One of my favs."—Reader</li>
							 <li>"Excellently written, well thought out, and deeply touching[...]truly captured the mysteries (Mysterion, smile) in daily living which exist for us all. The story felt like a love note to a single life which could be extended to all of our lives."—R. J. Johnson</li>
							 <li>"I was digging through some fairly obscure magazines to see if anything caught my eye, and this one did from the very first line and didn’t let up from there, delivering a tale of overdose, emotional isolation, and being there for others in a way no one was there for you. It’s touching, but in a way that never feels like it’s taking the easy way out."—Jay Tar Vol on Science Fiction and Fantasy Blog (full fiction round-up <a href="https://www.tarvolon.com/2024/06/04/may-2024-round-up-and-short-fiction-miscellany/" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>!)</li>
							 <li>"Another story with a great narrative voice, this one is told by a woman who died of overdose and has since found herself pulled to others on the brink of death. We see one particular attempt to claw a man back from the grave, interspersed with heartbreaking reflections on emotional isolation. A gripping read that never takes the easy way out."—<a href="https://www.tarvolon.com/2025/03/06/tar-vols-2024-recommended-reading-list-and-short-fiction-top-ten-awards-season-edition/" target="_blank"><i>Tar Vol’s 2024 Recommended Reading List and Short Fiction Top Ten: Awards Season Edition (Short Stories/Top-Tier Favorites)</i></a>!</li>

						 <h3><a id="castoffs">Castoffs</a> in It Was All a Dream: An Anthology of Bad Horror Tropes Done Right</h3>
						 <br />
						 <p><strong>Payment by the pound . . .</strong></p>
<p>A decade later, a demon shows up to collect his payment. Dinner aims to deliver.</p>
						 <p><em>My gross-out horror-comedy short </em>Castoffs<em> is just one of 28 tropey tales of horror and madness collected in this subversive anthology featuring a star-studded lineup and custom b&w retro-horror-style interior artwork for every story.</em>
							 </p>
						 		<p><strong>Awards/Accolades:
		</strong></p>
						 <ul>
							 <li>"Fun in its own insane, visceral way."—Reader</li>
							 <li>"It was funny – truly. Referring to the female character as dinner was hilarious[...] The journey of the demon putting out the candles is nice – especially because the candle names and scents themselves evoke an aura of middle-class blandness that becomes vivid for the reader."—Rejection</li>
							 <li>"This is extravagantly bizarre, and I mean that as the highest compliment. The “deal with the devil” scenario has been done so often that it’s difficult to make that scenario seem new and imaginative, but you manage to do just that. The mixture of lavish, mouth-watering food descriptions with the macabre scenario and the pound of flesh is equal parts tantalizing and perverse—I love it."—Rejection
							<li>"It’s exactly the kind of bonkers, inside-baseball, disgustingly great spin on a well worn trope I was looking for when I started putting this together."—Editor</li>
						 </ul>

						 <p><em>Castoffs</em> is recommended for all ages. The anthology as a whole is recommended for mature/adult audiences only.</em>

		<p><strong>Awards/Accolades:
		</strong></p>
						 <ul>
							 <li>Silver Honourable Mention in the 2022 Writers of the Future Awards</li>
							 <li>"I admired much about this story, from the bold cuts in time to the understated way that information is conveyed."—Rejection</li>
							 <li>"Excellent voice, and a deft hand at weaving in the supernatural with the mundane (which, of course, makes the supernatural all that more remarkable). I admit, I thought this would be something of a vampire-inspired urban fantasy thing due to the soil in the bed bit at the beginning, but you pulled off the "fair folk" trope very well (all the various names for them [or should it be Themselves?] were a nice touch)."—Rejection</li>
							 <li>"Prose is so precise, bubbling with the strange and the melancholy and the wondrous. There’s a real, unpretentious confidence to the writing that I appreciate. You expertly navigate between so many modes—the mythic-fantastic and the bleakly apocalyptic, the sublime and the somber, the dangerous and the alluring."—Rejection</li>
							 <li>"Vivid and wonderful"—Rejection</li>
