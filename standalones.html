						 <h3>Unknown Worlds: A Song of Dark Things</h3>
						 <br />
<p><strong>Desperate to escape a dead-end future in the Scottish Highlands, a musical teen makes a deal with the fae to achieve her dreams of stardom, only to discover her heart's desire comes at an unexpected cost.
	</strong></p>
						 <p>Lee would sell her soul to be a rockstar, but no one’s buying. Well, no one around here, anyways. There’s little trade on the Morar Peninsula, and the holiday goers cluttering up the view show precious little interest in her soul. They’re more interested in a romantic highland getaway, clean rooms, and a view of the sea.
						 </p>
						 <p>Doesn’t matter. She has a plan, and a prospective buyer lined up. Though, if everything goes right, The Folk will deliver her heart’s desire at a much better price. She hopes to trade a night at best, a year at a bargain, and if it takes a century, well. That can be arranged.
						 </p>
<p>*A Song of Dark Things* is a contemporary dark fantasy inspired by Scottish fairytales *Thomas the Rhymer* & *The Fiddlers of Tomnahurich* and the author's travels at the edge of the (old) world.

						 <h3>The Unsought Light</h3>
						 <br />
<p>Hana dreams of floating away on the breeze like the cherry blossoms, but when an otherworldly stranger offers a chance at escape from the stifling bonds of her impending arranged marriage to the son of the clan lord, duty and desire collide in a war that threatens to bring down her family, her clan, and her village.
</p>
<p><strong>Freedom. Passion. Family. Fate. What do you do when there are no good choices left?</strong>
</p>
<p>A gothic retelling of the ancient Japanese folktale The Maiden of Unai, this short story explores the untold perspective of the "maiden" destined for an arranged political marriage in a time and place where family fortunes mattered more than individual happiness or choice. A historical tragic romance in the vein of Rome & Juliet with a supernatural twist.
