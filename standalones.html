						 <h3>The Patron Saint of Flatliners</h3>
						 <br />
						 <p><strong>Don't call her a ghost. And she's sure no angel. She's not sure what she is—besides lost. But when you flatline, she’ll be there. Fighting to send you back.</strong>
						 </p>
<p>Sancta Faustina doesn't know why she's summoned to the side of the many victims of Vancouver's toxic drug crisis. Maybe it has something to do with the way she lived. Maybe it has something to do with the way she died. All she knows is there's yet another body cooling on the ground in yet another tired walkup, a disembodied spirit bobbing halfway to the ceiling, and the clock is ticking towards one very confused electrician's brain death . . .
