<h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
				 <br />		    
<p class="lead">K.A. Wiggins (Kaie) is an award-winning Canadian author of speculative fiction for all ages and fantasy with an edge for young readers. She writes difficult stories about difficult people (usually in entertainingly difficult situations!)
		    </p>
	<p class="lead">Her work explores social movements, environmental crises, and identity issues through intricate, dreamlike tales of monsters and magic.
		    </p>
		    				 <br />		    
		    <h3 class="text-center">Background</h3>
		    				 <br />		    
<p>Born in Vancouver and raised all across Western Canada, Kaie has been creating urban legends about witches in the back wood and fairies in the snow melt since she was seven years old. She writes prickly misfits challenging the borders of the mundane, inspired by current stars Brenna Yovanoff, Kendare Blake, and Laini Taylor, and fantasy legends J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Madeleine L'Engle.
	</p>
		    <p>With the encouragement of a series of incredible teachers (shoutouts to Greg Holowka of Angus McKay Elementary in Winnipeg, Lenora Esau of Mt. Slesse Middle, and Diane Turner of Sardis Secondary!), she started writing as a teen and gained recognition for her fiction and nonfiction in a variety of contests, most notably for her fable-like children's story, <em>Hiding a Pearl.</em>
</p>
<p>She supplemented a Bachelor of Arts (English Language & Asian Studies) at the University of British Columbia with intensive workshops in editing and rewriting fiction and children's publishing with award-winning children's publisher Tradewinds Books. For several years, she worked in corporate marketing and business analysis in Vancouver before launching a second career in writing and editing.
</p>

		    		    <h3 class="text-center">Milestones</h3>
		    				 <br />		    
		    <p>Her debut novel, <em>Blind the Eyes</em>, was selected by Barnes & Noble Press as one of their "20 Favorite Indie Books of 2018," recognized by the Page Turner Awards' with their eBook Award 2020 Book Spotlight Prize, and awarded the Reader Views 2021-2022 Literary Awards Bronze Prize in Children's Books Classics (for pre-2021 releases).
</p>
         <p>Her short side story, also in the Threads of Dreams series, <em>Letter from the End of the World</em>, has been translated into Italian and released by international publisher Virgibooks, Inc. as <em>Lettera dalla fine del mondo</em>. Her short fiction has also been published in Enchanted Conversation: A Fairytale Magazine, Frozen Wavelets by The Earthian Hivemind, and by Flame Atlas Press. 
</p>
	<p>In 2019, she was honoured to be invited to present on how to get started as a young writer, worldbuilding for storytellers, how stories (speculative fiction) reflect and help us in everyday life, and a masterclass for adults on paths to publishing at Mumbai's first (and the world's largest) Children's Literature Fest sponsored by ORCHIDS The International School.
		    </p>
		    <p>In 2021, she completed her first series, <em>Threads of Dreams</em> with the publication of <em>Burn the Skies</em>, was elected President of the Children's Writers and Illustrators of British Columbia, and took first place in the Literary Arts category of the Abbotsford Arts Council "Arty Awards."
		    </p>
		    <p>In 2022, she moderated panels and presented talks and workshops with <a href="https://www.wordvancouver.ca/" target="_blank">WORD Vancouver</a>, the <a href="https://bclaconnect.ca/yaacs/" target="_blank">BC Library Association's Young Adults and Children's Services Youth Services Intiative</a>, <a href="https://www.storystudio.ca/" target="_blank">StoryStudio</a>, <a href="https://www.businessforauthors.com/weeknight-writers/" target="_blank">Weeknight Writers' Storycrafting Sessions</a> and the <a href="http://bctla.ca/" target="_blank">BC Teacher-Librarians' Association</a>'s Fall Conference.
