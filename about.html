<h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
				 <br />		    
<p class="lead">K.A. Wiggins (Kaie) is a Canadian writer who publishes fantasy with a speculative edge for young readers. Her work explores social movements, environmental crisis, and identity issues through intricate, dreamlike tales of monsters and magic.

		    <h3 class="text-center">Background</h3>
		    				 <br />		    
<p>Born in Vancouver and raised all across Western Canada, Kaie has been creating urban legends about witches in the back wood and fairies in the snow melt since she was seven years old. She writes prickly misfits challenging the borders of the mundane, inspired by current stars Brenna Yovanoff, Kendare Blake, and Laini Taylor, and fantasy legends J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Madeleine L'Engle.
	</p>
		    <p>With the encouragement of a series of incredible teachers (shoutouts to Greg Holowka of Angus Kay Elementary in Winnipeg, Lenora Esau of Mt. Slesse Middle, and Diane Turner of Sardis Secondary in Chilliwack!), she started writing as a young teen and gained recognition in local and international writing contests, most notably from the BC Law Society for her fable-like children's story, <em>Hiding a Pearl.</em>
</p>
<p>She supplemented a Bachelor of Arts (English Language & Asian Studies) at the University of British Columbia with intensive workshops in editing and rewriting fiction and children's publishing with award-winning children's publisher Tradewinds Books. For several years, she worked in corporate marketing and business analysis in Vancouver before launching a second career in writing and editing.

		    				 <br />		    
		    <p>Her debut novel, <em>Blind the Eyes</em>, was selected by Barnes & Noble Press as one of their "20 Favorite Indie Books of 2018."
</p>
         <p>Her short side story, also in the Threads of Dreams series, <em>Letter from the End of the World</em>, has been translated into Italian and released by international publisher Virgibooks, Inc. as <em>Lettera dalla fine del mondo</em>.
</p>
	<p>In 2019, she was honoured to be invited to present sessions on how to get started as a young writer, worldbuilding for storytellers, how stories (speculative fiction) reflect and help us in everyday life, and a masterclass for adults on paths to publishing at Mumbai's first (and the world's largest) Children's Literature Fest sponsored by ORCHIDS The International School.

<p>Originally from Vancouver, BC, she freelances as a business writer and marketing consultant at <a href="https://businesswriting.solutions" target="_blank">Business Writing Solutions</a> in the Fraser Valley/Pacific Northwest when she’s not working on her next story. As an international speaker, she also teaches sessions, workshops and masterclasses on writing, storytelling, and publishing topics for ages 10 and up.
