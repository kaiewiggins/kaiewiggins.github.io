<h2 class="text-center">About</h2>
				 <br />		    
<p class="lead">K.A. Wiggins (Kaie) is an award-winning Canadian author of fantasy with an edge and dark speculative fiction for children, teens, and adults/all ages. Her work explores social movements, environmental crises, and identity issues through intricate, dreamlike tales of monsters and magic.
		    </p>
		    				 <br />		    	    
<p>Born in Vancouver and raised all across Western Canada, Kaie has been creating urban legends about witches in the back wood and fairies in the snow melt since she was seven years old. She writes prickly misfits challenging the borders of the mundane, inspired by YA stars Brenna Yovanoff, Holly Black, and Laini Taylor, and fantasy legends J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and Madeleine L'Engle.

		    <p>With the encouragement of a series of incredible teachers (shoutouts to Greg Holowka of Angus McKay Elementary in Winnipeg, Lenora Esau of Mt. Slesse Middle, and Diane Turner of Sardis Secondary in Chilliwack!), she started writing as a teen and gained recognition for her fiction and nonfiction in a variety of contests, most notably for her fable-like children's story, <em>Hiding a Pearl.</em>
</p>
<p>She supplemented a Bachelor of Arts (English Language & Asian Area Studies) at the University of British Columbia with intensive workshops in editing and rewriting fiction and children's publishing with award-winning children's publisher Tradewind Books. For several years, she worked in corporate marketing and business analysis in Vancouver before launching a second career in writing and editing.
</p>
				    <p>Her debut novel, <em>Blind the Eyes</em>, was recognized in multiple lists and awards, and her multi-awarded short fiction has been licensed for print, digital, translation, and audio adaptations by leading genre magazines and small presses since then including <em>Lightspeed Magazine, The NoSleep Podcast, Fantasy Magazine, Mysterion, Pulphouse Magazine,</em> Hungry Shadow Press, and Renaissance Press.

	<p>In 2019, she was honoured to be invited to present workshops for young writers and a masterclass for adults at Mumbai's first Children's Literature Fest, sponsored by ORCHIDS The International School, and discovered the only thing she loves (almost) as much as writing are speaking and teaching. She's since become known as an enthusiastic, engaging, and insightful speaker, teaching at workshops, camps, festivals, conferences, and institutes across BC and internationally.
		    </p>	    
		    <p>In 2024, she relocated from the Fraser Valley to the Comox Valley, launching a fresh chapter in her writing, speaking, Arts leadership/community building, and creative education career. 2025 saw exciting developments in "best-of" and "by-invitation" anthologies and international speaking, with a teaching trip to South Korea for library visits and a creative writing intensive, a featured spot as one of six "anchor authors" in Ansible Press's <em>Year's Best Canadian Fantasy and Science Fiction: Volume 3</em> and another shortlisted for Tenebrous Press's <em>Brave New Weird: The Best New Weird Horror Volume 3</em>, plus a private call anthology from Black Cat Books.
