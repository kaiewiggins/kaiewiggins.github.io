[![The Replacement by Brenna Yovanoff](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5d9ccc35d544fcc85135fb8ae/images/2f8e4dcb-583e-4de4-a2e3-90bfda27f70a.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7507908-the-replacement#)
                        
[The Replacement by Brenna Yovanoff:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7507908-the-replacement#)For those who prefer their fae bloodthirsty and horrific instead of sparkly and romantic. This was a rare 5 star read for me. Excellent character development, worldbuilding, and storytelling.

Also check out [The Space Between](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10261812-the-space-between) for demonic thrills and chills, [Fiendish](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18667948-fiendish) for Southern Gothic-horror...yeah, just go ahead and add all her books to your TBR.


[![Anna Dressed in Blood by Kendare Blake](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5d9ccc35d544fcc85135fb8ae/images/dad77f38-c04d-458c-a830-8b7d5aac20f8.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9378297-anna-dressed-in-blood?ac=1&from_search=true#)

[Anna Dressed in Blood by Kendare Blake:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9378297-anna-dressed-in-blood?ac=1&from_search=true#) Ghost hunter. Ghost girl bent on bloody revenge. Who wouldn't fall in love with a girl ready to rip your heart out? Think Supernatural with teens.

Also check out another skilled WA-based author, [Lili St. Crow's Strange Angels](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6006518-strange-angels?ac=1&from_search=true#) for a super dark gender-swapped take on monster hunting.


[![The Summoning by Kelley Armstrong](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5d9ccc35d544fcc85135fb8ae/images/0a917310-8188-4a63-9584-770936b4e6fa.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2800905-the-summoning?ac=1&from_search=true)
            
[The Summoning by Kelley Armstrong:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2800905-the-summoning?ac=1&from_search=true) Classic teens-with-powers, but one happens to be a necromancer. The only thing worse than being trapped in a spider-infested, lightless underground crawlspace is knowing something's clawing its way up from below.

Also check out her YA thrillers [Missing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25487124-missing) and [The Masked Truth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24733600-the-masked-truth?ac=1&from_search=true) for horror sans paranormal.

                  
[![The Near Witch by Victoria Schwab](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5d9ccc35d544fcc85135fb8ae/images/119f7d3a-0f45-4e84-9637-e9f968344345.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6931344-the-near-witch?ac=1&from_search=true#)

[The Near Witch by Victoria Schwab:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6931344-the-near-witch?ac=1&from_search=true#) Seems like this is the least-hyped of Schwab's work, but IMHO definitely the creepiest. Seriously. Classic fantasy with a terrifyingly tangible setting and evil at every turn out to get you.

Also check out [The Archived](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10929432-the-archived?ac=1&from_search=true#) for even *more* ghost hunting.

                        
[![The Diviners by Libba Bray](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5d9ccc35d544fcc85135fb8ae/images/dc47702e-3140-49eb-a55c-f15b397f58f7.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15783083-the-diviners)

[The Diviners by Libba Bray:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15783083-the-diviners) Left this one for last because it seriously pushes the limits of my horror tolerance - like, don't-read-at-home-alone level scary.

The Roaring 20s historical fiction setting and over-the-top characters are lots of fun, but the monsters are... yikes. Make sure you have a buddy to check under the bed for you.
