So first week: 3 days of writing, maximum of two hours in a sitting. 

Not great, but not terrible for being half on vacation. 

However, hours of doing nothing (Netflix...) don't seem to be contributing to great creativity and midnight productivity as I had first assumed. Must find some other way of spending my days that doesn't involve creativity or occupying my brain too greatly. 

Solution: went out of town for the week to my parent's place. 

Pros: people to talk to all (/most of the) day, free food and entertainment, cats, air conditioning, no screaming, thumping children, less ability to lay around watching tv all day. 

Cons: Abbotsford, full days with little time to be productive, +5 degrees heat or more. 

They've offered to let me move home to conserve funds while I play author. Time to find out if I can survive that life, or if it's back to the desk for me.
