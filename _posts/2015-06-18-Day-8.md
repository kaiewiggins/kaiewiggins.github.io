I need a villain. 

There’s a mystical evil force, a shadowy government conspiracy, a charismatic and twisted rebel leader and a crappy middle management boss… 

Come to think of it, I’m pretty sure I’ve never written a villain, well or otherwise. Kinda afraid of going there, really. The heart of darkness and all that. 

Where can I bury a criminal mastermind in the cast? Are they there masquerading as good or neutral from the start? Or hiding to be revealed in glimpses or just near the end? 

The perfect villain is almost as key as the hero, maybe even more so. Sauron. Voldemort. Darth Vader. 

Crap, pretty much no idea where to start. 

…In other news, I’m taking steps to disengage from Vancouver and enter self-imposed exile in Abbotsford (the small, uncool city in the region) to save money and fund this enterprise.
