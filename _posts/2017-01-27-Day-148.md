Still hate doing plots. Still kinda overwhelmed and procrastinate-y. Still trying anyways. 

The upshot of all my procrastination is, Iâ€™ve finally channeled it into something productive. By focusing on the bookstagrammer community on Instagram, following the heck out of people, posting slightly better and definitely more on-topic photos and engaging in interactions including shoutout sessions and supportive commenting, Iâ€™ve more than doubled my follower count in less than a month (about two weeks) to over 500, with about 50 new followers a day right now. Iâ€™m channeling success there to Goodreads, adding anyone whoâ€™s account I can find, with massive success at almost 100 followers up from less than 20 two weeks ago. FB, Twitter & Tumblr are still no goes, and Iâ€™m not-so-seriously considering dropping Tumblr given the high level of investment and low returns. Lots of porny accounts following me and not much elseâ€¦ but I could probably do better on any or all of these accounts if I needed to, using pretty much the same strategy as IG. So on the marketing front, Iâ€™m not killing it, but I am seeing some marked progress! Hooray for small victories! To-do items include continuing and increasing growth on IG, reaching out to reviewers and book bloggers specifically to prep for Blind the Eyesâ€™ release, and figuring out how to get a mailing list growing as well, given that everyone seems to think thatâ€™s the highest value thing to doâ€¦

Oh yeah, and writing a great book that everyone will love. Which brings me back to procrastination and impossible issues like, how do I make Cole compelling, since sheâ€™s certainly not lovable? Is it enough that sheâ€™s transparent in her issues at the start? Will readers be able to relate to her twisted, conflicted approach to the world? Have I built clear cause-effect into the story so she has to live out and overcome the results of her actions? Oh, and all the other characters - worthwhile? I have to find a way to make Itri and Ravel appealingâ€¦ And everyone should be complex, not just one-note, and the whole thing should be achingly truth-telling with heart and expansion potential.

So no big deal at all, right?
