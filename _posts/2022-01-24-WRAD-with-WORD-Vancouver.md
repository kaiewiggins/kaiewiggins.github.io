**Date:** February 2, 2022

**Time:** 11-11:45 am PST

**Location:** virtual

**Type:** Live reading, book talk + Q&A

[World Read Aloud Day](https://www.litworld.org/worldreadaloudday) is a "celebration of the power of reading aloud to create community, to amplify new stories, and to advocate for literacy as a foundational human right."

Join us on February 2, 2022 from 11-11:45 a.m. PST for a FREE virtual reading and Q&A in support of the 13th annual World Read Aloud Day!

I'll be hosting this event, organized by the lovely folks at [WORD Vancouver](https://www.wordvancouver.ca/) festival in collaboration with [CWILL BC](http://www.cwillbc.org/). It features three BC authors of books for pre-K to YA ([Jami Gigot](http://www.jamigigot.com/), [Mahtab Narsimhan](https://www.mahtabnarsimhan.com/) & [Mark David Smith](https://www.marksmithbooks.com/)) reading from their recent releases and reflecting on what and who inspires their writing process.
