## I Read Canadian Day Online

**Date:** February 13 + week of February 17, 2021

**Time:** 9am - 8pm PST

**Location:** your classroom, library, or book club via Zoom (or similar)

**Type:** Live Reading 

"[I READ CANADIAN DAY](https://ireadcanadian.com/day/) is a national day of celebration of Canadian books for young people. This is a day dedicated to ‘reading Canadian’ and will empower families, schools, libraries and organizations to host local activities and events within the week."

As creators of books for young readers, many members of [CWILL BC](https://cwillbc.org) are offering free 10-20 min. virtual readings in support of this wonderful cause.

While I'm more than happy to present to classrooms, library groups or book clubs of all ages, my fiction currently targets ages 14+, so for elementary or middle school groups I will instead be reading from an age-appropriate Canadian children's book that inspires me. 

Shoot me a message at [kaiewrites@gmail.com](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) to book a free 10-20 minute reading, workshop, or author visit on February 13 or the week of February 17, 2021!
