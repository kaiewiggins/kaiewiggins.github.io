Reminder: [join the newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/7852e61cb116/ka-wiggins-ya-dystopian-dark-fantasy-newsletter) to be the first get content like this and more exclusives. Here's a quick list of what's going on:

- Kindle Scout update
- ARCs are coming~
- Giveaways

### So, about that Kindle Scout campaign . . .

First off, thanks for all your nominations! You pushed BLIND THE EYES to the trending list on Kindle Scout!

. . . Unfortunately, they announced their plans to cancel the whole program on the last day of its campaign, so . . . yeah.

Corporations . . . *mumble grumble*

Just wanted to say how much I appreciate your support in this prelaunch phase. It's been a long wait, but we're finally nearing the end -- aaand, on that note:

### ARCS are coming!!

 . . . for real this time!

I'm not *quite* ready to announce preorder and on-sale dates for BLIND THE EYES, but plans are well underway. There are a few extra hoops to jump through in order to get print editions, but digital Advanced Reading Copies/Review Galleys/Digital Proofs (whatever you want to call them) are nearly ready to head out into the world.

If you're a book blogger, reviewer, #bookstagrammer, etc. and would like an early review copy of the ebook, [get in touch](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com)!

### The prequel you didn't know you needed

Um, yeah. It sort of just snuck up on me?

I mean, there I was, minding my own business, racing to get BLIND THE EYES out to you and the sequel underway and . . . BELOW THE SURFACE pulled a JAWS on me and dragged me under.

What it is: a spinoff short that takes place ~6 years before the events of BLIND THE EYES and the main THREADS OF DREAMS trilogy.

> Blurb: The twins' bond kept them together through their parents' murder, the memory wipe, and assignment to separate work divisions in the Towers of Refuge, the only surviving habitat in their flooded city. 

> But when protective older sister Ange follows carefree Amy into the abandoned lower reaches of the towers, the secrets they discover below the waterline could sever their bond for good.

> A dystopian dark fantasy that ranges from the sterile Towers of Refuge to glittering clubs and abandoned tunnels, BELOW THE SURFACE is a prequel to the Threads of Dreams trilogy and blends monsters and magic with near-future post eco-disaster cityscapes and a splash of romance.

I'm doing this for Camp NaNoWriMo, which is a spinoff version of National Novel Writing Month where you set your own goals and pick a writing target for the months of April and July. The idea is for this to be a long short story or short novella, in the 20-30k word range, that I can release as a free newsletter exclusive in the next couple months.

So in other words, sorry that you're going to have to wait longer for a sequel, but on the flip side, there'll be something cool to read in the meantime~

### Fantasy Giveaways~~
