So um, yeah. A long weekend to escort mom to family up north turned into a week. Notâ€¦ not quite sure how that happened. Other than, my ability to focus is apparently connected very little or not at all to the urgency of deadlines. Ugh. I had hoped to squeeze some work in on the drive up or while we were out there, even if just to knock off that one outstanding freelance assignment, but while 5 hours feels like ages to sit in a car, itâ€™s apparently not long enough for me to pull out the laptop. And then, once up there it was justâ€¦ yeah, focus. Donâ€™t have much of it.

And then coming back, one thing led to another andâ€¦ yup. Two days blown on catching up on stuff without actually getting the main things taken care of. In my defence, Iâ€™d probably have churned out something yesterday if we hadnâ€™t had a storm front moving in and I hadnâ€™t had a passed out/nap afternoon because Iâ€™m too much of a wimp to work through atmospheric pressure changes. So that wasâ€¦ well, actually it was kinda fun, but also frustrating because PRESSURE and DEADLINES!!! I had this awesome fever dream where there was a leech in my mouth attached somewhere in the back of my throat and at first I didnâ€™t realize it was there, and then I knew it was there and couldnâ€™t get it out until I convinced somebody to just yank itâ€¦ yeah. Awesomely messed up. And creepy but not in a night-terror-y sort of way. I mostly donâ€™t get scared when Iâ€™m lucid-dreaming, even if theyâ€™re situations that I should be scared of. Which is perhaps why I donâ€™t write good horror.

Iâ€™m reading the second book in Libba Brayâ€™s Diviners series and annoyed at the dream walkers. I canâ€™t decide if Iâ€™m on-trend or just boringly derivative. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d lifted the idea from anyone, but maybe subconsciouslyâ€¦? At least itâ€™s not shifters, lol. 

Of course, all this lack of productivity is probably just a smoke screen so I can keep myself from realizing how terrifying it is that Iâ€™m pretty much down to the wire with story changes and Iâ€™ll be judged but good on what I come out with past this pointâ€¦ I totally believe in no-mercy reviews, but it does give one pauseâ€¦ especially how every indie author out there seems to think theyâ€™ve done a great job and all due diligenceâ€¦ yikes.

Iâ€™m not the biggest Maggie Stiefvater fan ever; sheâ€™s a good writer, I just canâ€™t get into her stuff. But some of her comments on writing have been very helpful. Particularly her article (blog?) on drawing and characterization in storytelling. (Unless that was Julianna Baggottâ€¦ who it totally could have beenâ€¦) Anyways, the idea is we tend to have levels of clarity and quality in literary portrayal that can be broken down like stick figure > comic art > realistic art > photorealistic art, roughly. Like the difference between drawing lollipop trees to sketching off of reference to a line drawing thatâ€™s indistinguishable from a photograph. And beginner writers start somewhere in the stick-figure to comic art range with first drafts. Itâ€™s maybe identifiable as a person - possibly because you told us, proudly, that thatâ€™s what you meant to create. But it lacks depth, dimension, realism. So you flesh it out, after a tough reader or your editor gives you a poke. And it looks more human. But often you donâ€™t make it to the photorealistic level. And, arguably, that might be ok. You might choose to make artistic decisions that take you away from a perfect image to craft a better reading experience. But if characters stay two-dimensional, you probably havenâ€™t learned to flesh them out properly. Which is all to say, I probably struggle with characterization, but my male characters and villains in particular are barely past stick-figure level and itâ€™s a problem. Partly, being caught in Coleâ€™s POV feeds that issue, because she doesnâ€™t relate to others enough to be perceptive yet, but Iâ€™m trying to remember that making artistic choices that arenâ€™t in the service of the story is gonna hurt down the road. So thereâ€™s that.
