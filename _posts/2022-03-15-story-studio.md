I had a great time speaking on fantasy writing for the spring term of [StoryStudio's](https://www.storystudio.ca/) Young Writers Guild. You can read the teens' fantastic writing in a beautiful anthology (including a small write-up on my presentation!) Check out their anthology [here](https://www.storystudio.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spring-Zine-Issue-5_web.pdf)!
