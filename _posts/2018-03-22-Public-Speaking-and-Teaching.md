I'm passionate about encouraging, inspiring, and equipping readers and writers of all ages and welcome the opportunity to join events including festivals, conferences, school visits, camps and workshops, and more, schedule permitting.

I'm a registered speaker with the Children's Writers & Illustrators of British Columbia (CWILL BC) Society. (*[Speaker's profile.](https://www.cwillbc.org/Member_View.aspx?MemberID=82980)*.) [Learn more about funding grants](http://artstarts.com/grants) for BC community events such as school and library visits.

I'm also a creative writing coach with [Creative Writing for Children Society](http://www.cwc2004.org/), and have experience creating curriculum and facilitating camp and term-length workshops on creativity, storytelling, and writing themes for ages eight and up.

Previous, one-off, in person and remote festivals, sessions, workshops, panels, and masterclasses have included topics on writing and storytelling, publishing (traditional, hybrid & indie), and motivation and resiliency for ages 10 and up. I've spoken to elementary, middle school, high school, and adult audiences. As a business writer, I also offer communications and marketing training for adults (these sessions are generally promoted separately via [The Creative Collective](http://thecreativecollective.net).)

Please enquire regarding dates, fees, and any other pertinent logistics with as much notice as possible.

Fees are generally [in line with local standards](https://www.cwillbc.org/tips.htm), but may be subject to adjustment based on the specific event. Nonprofits should enquire about discounts or alternate arrangements if budget is a barrier. Assistance with grant and funding applications may be available.

Home base is Abbotsford, BC and the nearest international airports for travel purposes are Abbotsford or Vancouver, BC.

I have a couple mini writing tips posted on social: *[Spooky Middle Grade Openings](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CZfSxMglu1T/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)* and *[Speculative Worldbuilding Skills](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CaatDV5gUDb/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)*, and here's a quick video created by the awesome team at ORCHIDS Childrens Literature Fest (Mumbai, India) with some classroom teaching footage:
