I'm passionate about encouraging, inspiring, and equipping readers and writers of all ages and welcome the opportunity to join events including festivals, conferences, school visits, camps and workshops, and more, schedule permitting.

Previous sessions, workshops, and masterclasses have included topics on writing and storytelling, publishing, and motivation and resiliency for ages 11 and up. As a business writer, I also offer communications and marketing training (these sessions are generally promoted via [Business Writing Solutions](https://businesswriting.solutions).

Please enquire regarding dates, fees, and any other pertinent logistics with as much notice as possible.

Fees are generally [in line with local standards](https://www.cwillbc.org/tips.htm), but may be subject to adjustment based on the specific event. Nonprofits should enquire about discounts or alternate arrangements if budget is a barrier.

Home base is Abbotsford, BC and the nearest international airport for travel purposes is Vancouver, BC.

Please [get in touch](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) to discuss your event!
