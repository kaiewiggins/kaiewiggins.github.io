Delighted to announce "The Tangle (Did Not Kill Kitsault)" just got shortlisted in Tenebrous Press's *Brave New Weird: The Best New Weird Horror Volume 3*!!

I love this weird homage to Brenna Yovanoff's structural refrains, Canada's most bizarre ghost town, and the forest's revenge.

Special thanks to *Strange Horizons* for picking it up last Julyâ€”[you can read it on their site for free now](http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/the-tangle-did-not-kill-kitsault/)!

And whether or not it makes the final print, you'll want to grab your copy of 2024's finest weird horror over on Tenebrous's site come June.
