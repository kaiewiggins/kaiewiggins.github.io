Still plugging along at a snailâ€™s paceâ€¦ well, thatâ€™s not entirely fair; Iâ€™m keeping up roughly 4 hours a day/3K-ish words/2 chapters, but it feels like slogging. Only got my Wattpad chapter out with 30min. to go yesterday. The idea of worrying about what comes next (travel/work, even marketing/sales) is overwhelming, so Iâ€™m just not dealing with it, which is going to bite me down the road, but I canâ€™t bring myself to really care just now. Which makes things out to sound worse than they are; Iâ€™m continuing to be productive, moving towards a goal and wishing I were more successful already doesnâ€™t help anything. So, back into the grind.

Part 2

Still plugging; thanks for the encouraging comments, IG/bookstagram followers! It helps! Feeling a little depressed b/c my parents are looking at jobs in the states and Iâ€™d either have to take a FT job or make it absolutely huge with this book immediately to be able to be close to themâ€¦ and also have to leave my new nephew and his family behindâ€¦ lame. But also potentially cool, â€˜cause theyâ€™re looking at the Oregon coast or New York area, and I like coastal foggy areas and cliffs, and NY is the heart of publishing so thatâ€™d be radâ€¦ Trying not to worry about the future and do the best I can now, but itâ€™s hard not to freak out sometimes and just keep focusing!
