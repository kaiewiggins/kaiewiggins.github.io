Big news! I just hired  a cover designer! There's a contract signed and everything! Everyone, meet [Maie I Design](http://www.maeidesign.com/)

I've got to get some materials over to her next week, and then should see new cover art mid April. Time to start planning the big cover reveal!

While I'm proud of what I've been able to pull together to market my book, serials and brand so far, part of being a professional is knowing when to bring in appropriate help to do the job right. Plus, I love that I can support other creatives and book lovers in the process.

So while it was a hard decision not to do everything myself (because control freak + bootstrap = DIY), I'm incredibly excited to see how far this crazy little dream of mine can make it out into the world.

Thanks for reading, following and supporting Indie, friends.
