So, I read a ton. Like, well over 150 books a year. And now that I've discovered [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/kaiespace), I also rate and review most of those books, and then feature them with dubious quality photography on [Instagram](https://www.instgram.com/kaie.space).

What I haven't done is launched a book blog/reviews section here, because let's be real; how often do I get around to updating? And how many of you hang out here on a regular basis? So. 

However, just last month I discovered [Booklikes](http://kaiespace.booklikes.com/), which not only shares reviews on-platform and pushes reviews to Goodreads, it collects them in a custom blog. Update one place with automatic syndication to all useful platforms? Yes please! 

All that to say: [Check out my book blog](http://kaiespace.booklikes.com/) for (mostly) YA Fantasy recommendations!

I also do bimonthly book recommendations and "best-of" lists in [my newsletter](http://eepurl.com/cSevwn), and those I will to take the time to host on this site (eventually), so look forward to it!
