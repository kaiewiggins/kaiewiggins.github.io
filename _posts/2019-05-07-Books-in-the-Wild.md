Watch this space; I update as more locations get added! Also, I'd love it if you'd take a moment to [let me know](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) if you spot it in any other retail or library locations.)

If you want to request one of my books (or any book, really) at a local indie bookshop, chain bookstore, or library, all you have to do is give them the author, title, and, if you can, ISBN number.

For *Blind the Eyes*, the ISBNs are:

ISBN 978-1-7751627-3-5 (paperback)
ISBN 978-1-7751627-2-8 (ebook)
ISBN 978-1-7751627-0-4 (hardcover)
