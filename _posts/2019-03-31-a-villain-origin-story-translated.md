## Letter from the End of the World

**Before her deal with the devil, Maryam Ajera was . . . anything but ordinary. Read the letter she can never send to the son she can never acknowledge confessing the true story of their world before its fall.**

Brilliant academic, driven professional, cynical wife, and reluctant mother, Maryam Ajera's ambition knows no bounds. She'll sacrifice whatever it takes to rise to the top. But when her secret mission to stop the end of the world gets hijacked by tragedy, the monstrous intelligence possessing her dying city forces her to choose between surrendering her life or signing on for an eternity of sacrifice.

**In a city overrun by monsters, she's not the only one who'll pay the cost.**
