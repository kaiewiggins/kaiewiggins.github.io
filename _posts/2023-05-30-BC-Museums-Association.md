## "Collaborating with BC Children's Authors & Illustrators" BC Museums Association x CWILL BC Webinar

**Date:** Wednesday, June 7, 2023

**Time:** 12-1 pm

**Location:** online

**Type:** 

I'm looking forward to showcasing all the exciting collaboration possibilities (and successful examples) between local kidlit creators and museums, galleries & other Arts institutions for the BC Museums Association.

I love history, and all of my series so far feature local history and/or scenes set at historic sites around the province (Burnaby Village Museum in *Black the Tides* from Threads of Dreams, ghostly flashbacks through the last 150 years of Chilliwack's history in CAVE STORY WIP, and SONGSTRESS WIP takes a detour through a kobold community hiding in Britannia Mine Museum), so it's going to be super fun to get to connect with this group!
