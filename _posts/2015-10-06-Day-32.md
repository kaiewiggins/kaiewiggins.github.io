So… sidetracked again! 

Errands, trips to Vancouver, distraction… federal elections’ coming up, so I just finished reading the entire Green Party position and joined up. As a creative, I feel the need to back utopian dreams over dirty political maneuvering. Or something. 

Also, saw a new film effort, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3752766/">Charlotte’s Song</a>, in the Vancouver Film Festival with a friend. Beautiful, but definitely some storytelling gaps that are making me sweat. Trying to do too much, lack of connection with characters, vague storylines and quick changes between setting, action etc. 

Sound familiar? Panic… 

Oh well, no way to go but forward!
