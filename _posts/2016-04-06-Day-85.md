OK, the plan is to get as much done as possible before the allergies/atmospheric pressure changes/flu explodes my head and I have to lose hours out of the day again. Seriously, I barely got anything done yesterday; pathetic. 

Oh, except for a little freelance research/copywriting project that paid less than a dollar an hour. Brilliant. At this point, I’m not sure I can think my way out of a box. But needs must. Whatever that means. At least the Scotch helps (temporarily). It’s always good to have a plan. Except when it’s not. 

Reading about the rural towns on the west coast of Ireland and wanting to move there to rescue them. Wonder if the cost of living is any cheaper? Although, I really must get over the hero complex where I instinctively want to fix any and every broken situation… Still, something to keep in mind for two years from now when the UK kicks me out after my visa expires… 

Assuming I have a better impression of the country after my upcoming trip with Rebel. And assuming the whole freelancing or writing thing works out… And assuming I can handle the rural thing and don’t need to live in the land of shiny new condos with no yard work and public transportation… 

So possibly not.
