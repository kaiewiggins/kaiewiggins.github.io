## Chapter 1: Trouble

<strong>Cole</strong>

Cadence speaks. Only I hear.

It’s ok though. I know she’s not a Dream. Not a wish. Not a daydream, ambition, or hope. That would be dangerous. But a girl who speaks only to me? That's perfectly within regulation.

Following holy Tower regulation is the way to a long and safe life.

I don’t know where Cadence came from. I think she’s always been with me. She might be my friend (but she’s kind of a pest). She speaks when I don’t. Or won’t. Or can’t. 

Like right now.

Technician Supervisor Kistr is chewing me out. 

Publicly. 

Slowly. 

“Dispassionately.” Supplies Cadence, flitting just outside of my sight. 

I resist the temptation to turn my head. The most I ever catch of her is a faint, pale flash as she ducks behind me. A private game of hers, no doubt. She’s always up to something, and somehow, always gets away with it.

“As evidenced by the droning voice and glazed expression.” Cadence continues, making a rude noise in my ear, and dissolving into peals of laughter. 

It makes it hard to hear Supervisor Kistr as he warms to his task. 

Cadence is wrong. Dispassionate is the opposite of the small man at the front of the room. Deliberate words filter past Kistr’s mask with exacting focus. Only the slightest tremble in his precise tones betrays him. That, and the dampness of his bulging eyes, his gaze elevated to another plane. They shine wetly with unseemly pleasure as he expounds on my sins. 

Which is fine. Formal reprimands are to be expected - at least it’s not Retraining. It’s regulation. It’s for my own good.

I lack focus. I show signs of ambition - and worse - imagination. My youth is no excuse. Tower Injunction No. 3: An idle mind draws down destruction. I am a disease that poisons the group. 

It’s nothing I haven’t heard before. Accusations that have followed me since that day on the Training Floor. 

Such a small thing, a moment’s lapse in concentration, as we recited the holy Tower Regulation.

I wasn’t resisting, when I said that Cadence had distracted me. She had been singing, something silly, nonsensical, but it had been enough to make my words falter, my voice dip in the chorused recitation. 

It was all her fault.

When I said as much, everything went wrong. I was yanked from the trainee cohort and reassigned to Retraining. 

I’m not ever going back. 

“Yup. That place was no fun at all,” Cadence says. “Sooo boring! And all those grownups? …hang on, isn’t it just. like. here? Despaiiiiir~”

I shift my shoulders, suppressing the futile, but tempting, urge to swat her away. 

Supervisor Kistr narrows his eyes at me and raises his tone as he continues. The words productivity and regulation figure largely in his speech. 

“Betcha he’s bald under his fancy-schmancy hood, Mr. Grumpypants” Cadence breaks in, snickering. “Despaiiiir~ no haiiiir~ despaiiiirrrr~"

Cadence singsongs with great dynamic range directly into my ear, making me burn to give her a good kick. My legs are getting sore from standing, knees locked, and I desperately want to shift my weight, but don’t quite dare. To make things worse, the bottoms on this latest uniform are too loose. They’re edging past my hipbones, one anxiety-spurring inch at a time. 

I squirm, ever so slightly, and get a warning glare from Kistr, who is coming up on the end of his rant, if past experience has anything to say about it. 

I sigh, but carefully, so that my mask doesn't flutter up and betray my frustration. I taste the sharp tang of blood, from biting my tongue to keep it still. Meanwhile, Cadence is losing interest in her little song. She now seems to be occupied with sucking the words in and out in a sort of humming sigh that it sounds like: (in)”~aaaAAAEEEiiirrrr~”(out)”~rrrRRRRRrrreeaa~” 

On repeat.

No one ever blames Cadence, exasperating pest that she is, just me. 

Always me.

So I do my best to ignore that little troublemaker. But she’s relentless, whispering and teasing and laughing, always dashing just out of sight when I try to catch her out. And maybe it’s my fault after all; everyone else seems to be able to ignore her just fine. Not that she ever seems to go off and bother them. 

It’s unfair, the way I catch all the blame. Like right now. 

“…complete an additional two segments H-and-R. Daily.” Supervisor Kistr is finishing up. 

I frown under my mask, careful to keep the upper half of my face blank so he won’t notice and increase my sentence for insolence. Whenever I resist, it’s ‘insolence’. Because of my ‘youth’. It’s definitely not because he’s a nitpicky old bully. 

I’m sure Kistr's well aware that I'm not a fan of the health and rec programming; he’ll have scoured my stats for the best punishment. Sorry, ‘remediation plan.’ Well, whatever. It’s not like there’s really any better way to spend time. 

I suppress another eye roll. My effort is in vain; Kistr raises an eyebrow, seeming to see past my mask to the dissatisfied twist beneath. His eyes crinkle at the edges.

“Also, a nutrition increase of 15%.” He finishes, trails of moisture seeping from his eyes as his cheeks threaten to engulf them, with a grin so wide it escapes the upper edge of his mask. The effect is unpleasant, but not nearly so much as his punishment.

“Hah! You’re just a kid, of course you should get more!” Cadence snorts. 

I stifle a shudder and ignore her. She’s not the one who’ll have to choke down an extra slurp of that dense, flavourless muck every morning and night. Although, on the bright side, every time they increase my nutrition allotment, it seems to dull her voice, at least temporarily.

I stiffen my back and let my eyes drift partway closed, making a conscious effort to look old, or at least older, and world-weary, as Supervisor Kistr eyes me. I make no response to his sentence. I am not expected to (although, I’m sure he’d have appreciated a little bow, or a few tears).

Cadence’s word irritates me, a not unwelcome distraction from Kistr’s beady-eyed inspection. Kid. It’s offensive - even more so than the supervisor’s frequent references to my youth, always with emphasis. Yet another failing, a shameful, inescapable uniqueness. I am the youngest in the room, by far.

The youngest to leave training (or rather, retraining), the youngest to join the workers, or so Cadence claims. 

She says seventeen. I don’t know how she’d know; the Tower doesn’t record ages. Just roles. Trainee. Worker. Supervisor. Senior.

But it’s obvious I’m the youngest; I keep growing. My ankles and wrists jut scandalously past the wide sleeves and loose pants of my uniform. Exposed flesh is also against regulation, not that that gets me new uniforms any more often. I have to work at wearing mine out fast, so they can be replaced. Though I’m clumsy enough that I don’t have to work hard at it.

I’m on my fourth set of uniforms since leaving training. The gold band of protection at my forehead and the printed ID code on my back and chest haven’t even had a chance to wear and dull on this one. On many of my coworker’s uniforms, the band is worn so thin and dull that it scarcely stands out against the neutral beigey drabness of our uniforms, and the ID codes are wrinkled and flaking, not like my shiny black print. 

No one else grows and changes here but me. 

I have been a digital technician, a full Worker, for fourteen months. I spent only four months in training, and another two years in retraining, absorbing holy Tower Regulation and learning my Skill with machines. 

Before that, I don’t remember.  But I do know that people have been in training for up to six years, and have even been sent back, if their Skill or ability to follow Regulation is weak. 

I don’t want to go back.

I was already taller than most of the others when I started on the training floor. My arms and legs are stretched by it, aching and bony, making me even thinner than the others, making it hard to move. You can see through the dusty tan - another mark of shame - of my stretched skin to deeper colours underneath, all shadows and movement. My hair grows faster too, passing Regulation length between trims, prickling around my ears and poking out the eye-opening of my uniform in violation of Regulation. Of course, it’s too dark as well, making the length even more noticeable, inky in contrast against the paler tone of my skin and against the bland uniform hood. 

It started with kids. Trainees don’t know not to talk at the beginning. The others said I must have been forgotten by the Growers and left too long. Overbaked, singed, burnt around the edges, my skin and hair too full of colour, not even close to Tower-approved ashy paleness. Well, I wasn’t the only one that wasn’t perfectly pale.

The real trouble was my size. Where the others were half my height, or less, they were also faster and more coordinated. In their high whispers, they said I'd been grown wrong, dark and stretched and oversized.

Cadence said no, I was just meant to be this way. She said tall is better anyways, for climbing trees and stuff. Whatever that means.

She said other things too, but I knew better than to repeat them. She tells so many strange stories and uses so many funny words and pretends to know so many things, and I never know when she’s making something up. Like trees. And climbing. And kids.

My favourite story is weather; I try to imagine what she means, and sometimes even achieve faint images with Cadence’s help: rain like a shower that covers the whole ceiling, sun brighter than the brightest lamp. Wind is mystifying, though, and snow, that rarest of phenomenon…

But this part of me is wrong too, the part that wonders, the weak, unfocused part that is tempted to listen to Cadence’s ridiculous fantasies. The part that is fooled into seeing things that aren’t there, flashes of a place that is not the Tower.

So maybe there’s a Grower somewhere on the Training Floor that got sent back to retraining for negligence. As they should have been, for such a monumental failure. 

It is not good to stand out. 

Cadence says she loves not being the same, which is ridiculous. 

If it weren’t for the Growers’ mistake, I would have been perfect. As it is, everything about me is too much, no matter how careful I am. Too tall. Too bony. Too dark. Too long. Too clumsy. 

Too imaginative. 

I would not be different from the others if I had the choice. 

Being different is dangerous. Being different causes reprimands, and other nasty things. 

Being different brings death.

“Liiiiieessss,” Cadence whispers, then chuckles, distracted by a new rhyme, which she proceeds to sing repeatedly: “No skyyyys just liiiies mad eyyyyes hates surpriiiiise~esss~~"

Supervisor Kistr wraps up his reprimand with a group chorus of holy Tower Regulation, watching me the whole time. After, I am allowed to sit. 

I move too fast, eager to change position, and bump my thigh against the arm of my chair with a clatter. The skin burns, and I know it will bruise bright, invisible patterns under my uniform. Great. Even darker, more colourful skin.

The reprimand this time had been longer than usual. My screen has gone blank, and I tap the terminal to wake it. This prompts a sharp look from Supervisor Kistr.

Productivity. Right. 

I shift uncomfortably, feeling the rasp of the sturdy seat covering through the folds of my uniform. A wheel squeaks, high and thin, and I freeze guiltily.

It’s not that I don’t get it. Everything, even my dull work, can disrupt the fragile balance that the Tower so carefully preserves. My own mind or someone else’s could be compromised, the briefest hint of ambition to compete, an unguarded moment, the merest spark of imagination could prove the opening needed for a Dream to take control. And then it all ends.

I do know obedience to regulation is the only way. Tower Injunction No. 2: A controlled mind is holy. Work, or any activity, really, takes second precedence to maintaining stability. 

It’s just, if the screen goes blank, it takes on the same drab hues as the rest of the console. And the chair. And the walls. Floor. Ceiling. Uniforms. Even, for many of us, skin tone. The gold net embedded in the light fixtures casts everything in a smudge of pale, muddy yellow. It all swims together, making me feel sick.

Hate is dangerous. Hate is not stable. Hate is a wish for change. A wish can disrupt the balance. 

So I do not hate the blank screen. I simply avoid it as much as possible. I do not wish to work more, or faster, or harder than anyone else. I just do not let the screen go blank.

“Stupid screen,” Cadence says. “Stupid beige. Stupid gold. Stupid uniform. Stupid pasty people. Stupid work. Stupid stupid stupid.”

I flinch. I can sense Cadence’s eyes rolling. She openly hates the beige drabness of our world, and loves tempting me to go along with her. I don’t know how she gets away with it. 

Cadence is grumbling in my ear: “Garbage-for-brains picking on you again. Not like he ever gets anything done, hiding out in his lame office. What gives him the right?! We should just walk out of here. What would he do then, huh? I bet even a Dream wouldn’t bother with him. No imagination at all!”

Cadence fumes for a few minutes, while I enjoy the silence. I can almost feel the air shift as she changes tack. 

"We could take off right now. Go to the health centre. Or the recreation centre. He wouldn’t even notice, not that rule-bound twit.” She wheedles, bored and looking for a reaction. 

Cadence keeps grumbling in the background as I type, only half listening to her. 

I could leave. Kistr has gone back to his shielded office, and unless a reprimand is triggered, he won’t bother with me again today. No one else will care. But I have no great love for the health or recreation assignments, where the activities are nearly as mind-numbing as the work we are assigned to. I do not care to return to my room simply to sleep and find temporary freedom from the boredom. I can’t be bothered to leave my desk, much less abandon work and go. 

“Play hooky.” Cadence chants, delighted with her latest nonsense word. 

I rub hard between my eyes, sighing. Cadence is relentlessly loud and talkative and smug. I don’t know anyone else like her. 

Although, I don’t actually know anyone else. That would be against Regulation.

An alert takes over my screen: time for a hydration break. 

I sigh again, consider dismissing the alert, push away from my desk and stand, looking towards the hydration console at the far corner of the room. 

There are people standing there. 

At this distance, I can’t hear voices, but their heads are bent together. I shiver, repulsed. 

Conversation. 

Socialization. 

Close contact with others violates Regulation and risks weakening the mind. Interpersonal relationships are to be avoided. (Cadence doesn’t count; she’s impossible to avoid. Trust me, I’ve tried.)

I look around, swallowing hard. No one else seems to be aware of this violation of Regulation. Even Cadence is silent, for once.

Taking a deep breath, I slip my hand into my hood and through my hair, scrubbing through the too-long mat of it, adjusting the drape of my mask to cover the strands better. The motion is calming; it clears my mind. 

It’s OK. I don’t have to interact. I’ll just get my drink, finish up as quickly as possible, and get back to my console. 

I eye the small crowd as I approach, a little breathless. Cadence is still chanting in the background. She doesn’t seem aware of how wrong it all is. 

Four of them. Three men and - could it be? - one woman. 

There are so few other women in the Tower, and such close contact with them is most definitely against Regulation. 

Two of the men and the woman are standard Tower stock, small, pale and colourless, fading against the bland walls so that it feels like I could see through them if I looked hard enough. Even their eyes are pale.

The other is different.

He's tall, maybe taller than me, even. It’s rare, but not unheard of. 

That's not what stills my steps and makes me stare.

“No. Way.” Cole breathes. 

I agree. I’ve never seen anything like him.

Black hair curls out the opening around his eyes, long and dark, improbably catching the light and reflecting back glistening purple-blue highlights. His eyes are subtly tilted and bright gold - as gold and shimmering as the smooth band around his head. I didn’t know human eyes came in that shade. The exposed skin above his mask glows with a soft golden warmth that stands out in sharp contrast to his hood and mask. 

I’ve seen tinges of colour to skin before, my own dusty-looking shade included, but never a deep, rich colour like his. And those eyes, lit from within, but dark at the same time; an endless pool of shining.

Gold. 

The colour of protection. 

Safety. 

Maybe that’s why he dares to stand so close to that woman, looking down at her with bright eyes, arms almost touching. Could it be why the others all lean in close, closer than I’d ever seen anyone get to another person, since my time with those stupid kids on the Training floor?

He draws them to him, like gravity, like a magnet, his pull natural and right. 

“Cole!” Cadence gasps, and I stumble, catch myself, glance up to meet the eyes of the golden man. 

He is - they are - staring at me now, just a few feet away. I had been heading right towards the small group, drawn in unawares. 

“Are you all right, Cole?” The golden man asks. His voice is liquid, deep and rich and smooth. I feel a spreading warmth that rushes from the pit of my stomach to heat my face.

He has no reason to know my ID. Did Kistr use my ID during the reprimand? How could he know?

My thoughts are scattered, memories distant behind the racing of my pulse, thundering in my ears, throbbing in my cheeks.

His bright-dark gaze draws mine irresistibly, his eyes upturned and fringed by long, dark lashes under a bold browline. I have to look up a little to meet it, tilting my head back. 

He smiles slowly, creasing around the eyes, a softening and sharpening all at once. 

It’s hard to breathe.

I blink, and the spell is broken. 

He should not have spoken to me. It’s against Regulation.

I nod to him and the group, a brittle jerk of the head, all the while looking hard at the seam where the floor angles into the pale walls, and edge around them towards the hydration console. 

“Would you like to join us, Cole?” The man invites. 

Cadence sucks in a quick breath.

I almost make the mistake of looking up again, drawn by the warmth in his voice. You can hear the gold in it, a soft, glowy weight.

No. He shouldn’t be talking. He shouldn’t know my name. This is against regulation. It’s not right.

It’s not safe. 

I shake my head, staring at the wall, resisting the pull. I can see his smile out of the corner of my eye, as he turns back to his group. 

“He’s no joke, that one!” Cadence whispers in my ear, shivering. “Ravelwan is something else. You know he’s a transfer? Not even from this Tower! Bad news.”

Ravelwan? A series ID? There are more like him? …and how does Cadence know about him, anyways?

He’s speaking to the group in hushed tones, and I can’t help but hear as I pretend to study the hydration console’s display. My ears tingle, drinking in that voice, my head hot, skin beneath my mask flushed.

“…at the East stairwell…” He’s saying. “No, that’s too early. 10:30. It’ll be quiet by then.”

“I miss winter,” The woman pouts. “No one leaves their room after six or so; we could have all night at the club!”

Winter? The club? 

The words don’t make any sense. Cadence refuses to explain, pouting. She wants to go, forget the consequences. 

“Leave it alone. I’ll tell you later.” Cadence says. “Get your drink and get back to your station. Better yet, just skip the stupid drink.”

“Yeah, that hatch across from the elevators. What do you mean you’ve never gone that way? How do you usually get out?” One of the pale men is laughing at the other, while the golden man - Ravelwan - and the pouting woman whisper together. 

Cadence drops silent at the word “out”, tensing, distracted.

“A way out…” She gasps the words, breathless. 

That's bad sign. It usually is, when Cadence shows an interest in something. Bad for me, anyways.

I feel a weight on my shoulder. Heavy, warm. 

I stare, horrified, amazed, at the golden hand gripping my shoulder, the fabric of his uniform spilling back from scandalously exposed flesh, no glove. I am suddenly conscious of an enormous warmth radiating against my back, a slight breeze stirring the edge of my hood. 

I am frozen. Immobile. Inanimate. 

Cole, for once, is just as horrified as I am.

My heart has surely stopped beating. My blood is pooled somewhere in my feet, vast distances away from my head. 

“Join us sometime, little flame.” He breathes in my ear. 

Ravelwan. 

Why…?

The bright hand moves to my collar, scratching at the border where the drape of my mask falls loose and the bottom half of my hood hangs over the neckline of my shirt, slipping something inside with a soft crackling so that it is pinned between my clammy skin and the light fabric. 

I don’t dare move a muscle as the warmth fades from my back. The blood that was pooled around my toes is shooting up all at once to heat my face, flushing my skin and drowning my thoughts. The rushing sound of it drowns out Cadence’s voice, muting the stream of what she calls ‘rude' words. 

I’m not sure if she’s scared or angry. I’m not sure if I am either. Or something else entirely.

All of a sudden, the only thing I can do is move, and I must move. No drink, no desk, no work. 

How can I go back to my console, sit, focus on a screen? For hours more? 

Without even processing the decision, my feet are taking me to the exit. To the corridor. The elevator. 

I glance at the wall across from the elevator, at the faintest seam outlining a large square area that starts at knee height and climbs to the level of my shoulders. 

How many times had I walked past it, not interested, unaware. 

“The way out?” Cadence says. 

I’ve heard that tone from her before. It’s a tone that sometimes creeps into her stories, the ones that start with “In the time before..”

We eye the seamed wall together, tracing the lines one by one, as if we can unlock it with our gaze. 

Regulation forbids it. 

But… The idea that there truly could be something more... More than the Training Floor, the work room and the personal rooms. More than programmed, mandated activity and health cycles, bland nutrition allotments, sleep, work. 

A place where the threat of consequences wouldn’t be constantly pricking at the back of my mind.

Something new. Something unexpected. Like Cadence’s stories. What if they were real? What if even a fraction of the things in her stories could be found, just beyond that opening?

I reach for the hatch.
