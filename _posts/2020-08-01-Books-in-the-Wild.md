Watch this space; I update as more locations get added! Also, I'd love it if you'd take a moment to [let me know](mailto:info@kawiggins.com) if you spot any of my titles in any other retail locations so I can add them to the list!

If you want to request one of my books (or any book, really) at a local indie bookshop, chain bookstore, or library, all you have to do is give them the author, title, and, if you can, ISBN number.

You can find those details on the Standalones or specific series page via the menu. Thank you!
