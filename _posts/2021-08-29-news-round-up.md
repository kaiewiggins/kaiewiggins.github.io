Aaand just like that, summer's over! As usual, I've been too busy to share updates as they happen, so here's a quick rundown of what you may have missed:

#### Threads of Dreams Complete

*Burn the Skies* launched on July 6, completing the trilogy. [Binge the whole series today!](https://books2read.com/blindtheeyes)

#### Elections

The Children's Writers and Illustrators of British Columbia society elected me as president on June 30. If you're a published (or professionally indie publishing) illustrator or author of books for the under-18 crowd living in British Columbia, please join us at [cwillbc.org](https://cwillbc.org). We're doing a ton of cool stuff!.

#### Awards

Not sure I'm allowed to share the news yet, but there's a super fun awards nomination in the works that I'll be able to shout about soon. Thanks to whoever nominated me, btw!

#### Instagram Catastrophe

On the not-so-fun news side, my Instagram (@kaie.space) got unexpectedly shut down. Not sure if I got hacked or flagged by bots or something else, but it doesn't appear to be recoverable. Sad to lose 3,000+ connections and 5+ years of work, but moving on and starting over with a new handle. Join me [@kaiewiggins](https://instagram.com/kaiewiggins) for pretty(?) book photos and book reccs featuring YA fantasy and Canadian authors!

#### Up Next

I'm still dithering about what project to dive into next on the writing front, but I'll be teaching two anthology workshops with Creative Writing for Children in the fall term, growing CWILL BC's reach and effectiveness, and taking a continuing ed workshop on short fiction with WMG Publishing. Somewhere in all that, I need to plot and draft the next release, genre and title TBD.
