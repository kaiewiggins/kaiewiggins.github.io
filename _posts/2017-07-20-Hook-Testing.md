So apparently the first step to writing a good query letter is getting your "hook" down. Also known as logline, elevator pitch, this is a short, succint snapshot of your story designed to make peeps want more and should convey motivation, stakes and enough specifics to stand out from the crowd. Here's what I came up with:

1. When haunted probationee Cole flunks her trial, she learns hers isn’t the only life at stake and goes on the run to escape execution by nightmare. Now, with a ghost on her back, enforcers in pursuit and a charismatic rebel leader gaslighting her, Cole must figure out who to trust to bring down the state and stop the dying before the nightmares eat her alive.

2. In a world where hope kills and dreams are deadly, obedience is the only way to survive. But when one girl learns her society’s absolute control and guarantee of safety are both illusions, she risks her hard-won status, her home and her life to rebel and expose its lies.

3. A haunted failure has to destroy her authoritarian state before the nightmares eat her alive.

4. When haunted failure Cole indulges her obsession with the dead, she discovers obedience to the state never guaranteed survival. Now, with ghost-driven visions taunting her, she must find allies to destroy the state before the nightmares destroy her. 

5. A haunted failure has to destroy her authoritarian state by weaponizing her flaws/weaknesses(?) before demons devour her.

Aaaaand BONUS ROUND time. Another step (sometimes included in the hook) is coming up with Comp (comparative/competitive depending on who you ask) titles; books like yours already out there and being loved in the world. Here's my best guesses, which also double as a must-read list for all of you who like having out of control but so on point to read lists!
