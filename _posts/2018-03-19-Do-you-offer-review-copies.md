If you're a book blogger, reviewer, or bookstagrammer, first of all, you rock & I wish I could take photos even half as well as you.

Second, digital and a limited number of paper review copies (pre-publication proofs/galleys/advanced reader copies/ARCs or whatever you want to call them) of Blind the Eyes will be available starting in April 2018 - please [contact me](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) with the details of your blog or other online presence.

I welcome bloggers and reviewers from all countries; however, the ability to read and communicate in written English is a necessary requirement.
