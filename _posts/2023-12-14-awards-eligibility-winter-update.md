So, yeah, six+ months since the last update, probably a good moment to remind folks that my [newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/7852e61cb116/ka-wiggins-ya-dystopian-dark-fantasy-newsletter) goes out every second Monday if y'all want to hear from me more often.ðŸ˜…

Also, before I drop my release list, if you like speculative fiction but have limited reading time, Sonia Sulaiman has put together a great reading list of [Palestinian spec-lit that's really worth a look instead](https://soniasulaiman.com/readpalestinianspecfic-reading-list/).

### Quick round-up of 2023 publications for awards' eligibility & end of year reading list purposes:

#### Children of Earth

2,900 words. FANTASY MAGAZINE Issue 90 (April 2023)

Eco-anxiety takes on a life of its own in a body-horror-riffic romcom about a goblin-mode girl, toenail cryptids & a shared compost bin.ðŸŒ¿ This one goes out to all the Millennial renters~ðŸ˜˜ðŸ§µ

[Read (or listen) free online here.](https://www.fantasy-magazine.com/fm/fiction/children-of-earth/)

#### Castoffs

2,000 words. THERE'S NO PLACE (Renaissance Press, October 2023) 

A washed-up rockstar searches for home, hope & escape from fae-cursed hunger amidst the wreckage of the career she stole from under the hill and over the sea.

This is a Canadian small press anthology on housing insecurity/homelessness and my entry is an alternate/experimental retelling of "A Song of Dark Things" and the upcoming SONGSTRESS WIP.

This is a new release ebook/paperback with no free online version, but send me a message at [kaiewrites@gmail.com](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) to request a review copy of the story.

#### Spectres of the Old World "Micro-Trilogy"

A fast-paced, time-skip NA/YA Dystopian Fantasy of loss, destiny & inter-generational trauma in an eco-punk, post-apocalyptic world overrun by monsters. Spinoff of/parallel timeline to the THREADS OF DREAMS series.

A "micro-trilogy" of novelettes (adds up to a novella, basically; 28,000 words.) [free to read in KU](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BRP25PFY) or send me a message at [kaiewrites@gmail.com](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) to request a review copy.

### General Information:

All releases lean more fantasy than horror (but can usually cross over with dark fantasy/gothic or weird horror). Children of Earth and Spectres include SF elements. Children of Earth is the most accessible (& fun) of the lot. Wordcounts are given for each. I'm Canadian, so works are eligible for the Auroras, as well as awards like the Nebulas & Hugos. My work is NOT eligible for the Ignyte awards. Thanks for checking them out! :)

That's it for new releases from me this year (unless there are any late-breaking surprisesðŸ‘€) BUT you can find everything existing & announced on this site under the Available Now & Coming Soon sections of the home pageâ€”already three short pieces under contract or accepted for next year, with Submission Grinder stats looking promising for another few in short order~

As a general recap, it's been a weird year. Some high pointsâ€”lots of new milestones in terms of short fiction publishing, speaking, etc.â€”but also it's getting harder to stay focused and keep moving forward as the rest of the world unravels in spectacular fashion around us. So, yeah, no new novels this year! Better luck next year . . .ðŸ˜…
