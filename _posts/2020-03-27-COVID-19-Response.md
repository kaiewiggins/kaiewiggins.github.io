COVID-19 is causing widespread, rapid change around the world, and tbh it's hard to know what to say or how best to respond.

As a writer and freelancer, my lifestyle already looked a lot like self-isolation, except for creative writing workshops and speaking engagements, so for the moment, it's close to business-as-usual. I'll be working on sequel rewrites, keeping up newsletters and book marketing efforts, and priotizing freelancing a little more than I had been to make up shortfalls.

But I know a ton of people are going through a tough time financially or have lost their jobs entirely, at least during the regional lockdowns. 

I don't have enough of a backlist built up to offer much for free, but here's a list of libraries and subscription services where you can find ebooks of Blind the Eyes:

- [Vancouver Public Library](https://vpl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/6786290038)
- [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/book/387925871/Blind-the-Eyes-Threads-of-Dreams-1)
- [24 Symbols](https://www.24symbols.com/book/x/x/x?id=2833301)
- [Overdrive/Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/media/3995334/blind-the-eyes)
- [Kobo Plus](https://www.kobo.com/ebook/blind-the-eyes) (regional access)

I'm also dropping ebook prices to minimum ($0.99 or equivalent) [across storefronts](https://books2read.com/blindtheeyes) until the end of April at least to try to keep reading material accessible.

And, for those of you who've suddenly become homeschoolers (especially you BC parents without school support!), I'm open-sourcing some [teaching materials from my creative writing workshops](https://kaie.space/news/2020/03/20/learning-resources.html). They're tested on ages 8-12, but you could easily scale up or down a few years for maybe a couple hours of edutainment. ;D
