<small>Contains affiliate links.</small> I really want to get the other pieces moving. Set up a platform, start getting beta readers and fans, lol. Submit for peer review and get some feedback on the direction and tone. But I’m trying to gloss past actually writing the freakin’ thing. I need to accept that first drafts aren’t beautiful, or even that compelling and just get it all out on a page. 

Trying hard to shut down the part of me that wants to reengage with a career, start planning next steps and tracks to take… I want to do this, even when I don’t want to do this. I think. 

I may be overcomplicating things (including the plot and the characters!), but I don’t seem to be able to stop myself, so I guess I’ll just need to turn that into a strength.

 last night. Thinking that this may not be quite in the same vein as those dark dystopias (I’m looking at you, <a  href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B004XJRQUQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=B004XJRQUQ&linkCode=as2&tag=kaie06-20">Hunger Games</a><img src="http://ir-ca.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kaie06-20&l=as2&o=15&a=B004XJRQUQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

 series!) - I don’t want the death toll, and not sure I can generate the same degree of tension. 

I want to tell a story, build characters, but getting a tense plot with nonstop action and mind-bending twists, upping the ante continuously? How do they even do that? 

Maybe on the rewrites…
