## University of the Fraser Valley Young Writers' Conference

**Date:** Monday, April 28, 2025

**Time:** 9am

**Location:** UFV Chilliwack

**Type:** Workshop & Presentation

**Author AMA + Interactive Storytelling** (Ã‰cole Salish Secondary, time TBA)

So excited to kick off this growing program for middle school-aged writers with a combined author talk and mini-workshop on story structure featuring my interactive whiteboard storytelling. Can't wait to see what we come up with together!

Closed registration (arranged through SD33 middle schools).

*Note: I'll actually be on the mainland April 27-May 3, so for anyone in the Metro Vancouver & Fraser Valley region in need of author visits/school/library etc. bookings, it's a good time to nab one with no additional travel fees!*
