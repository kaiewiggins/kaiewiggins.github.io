Still debating how much material to go live with next (?) week. I’d like to throw everything out there, but as a friend pointed out, there’s a risk of feedback inhibiting the direction of the story, or the work being judged in an incomplete state to its detriment. But I don’t feel like I have the time to hold off until I’ve reached full completion… 

On the other hand, it’s a definite concern that I seem to like writing hints, teases and cliffhangers, but I don’t necessarily bring things around to answers in a cohesive, timely fashion. Those endings, though… Terrifying. 

Case in point; I spend whole chapters with Morris2 trapped in anguished torment, with bare moments of action sweeping in at the last second and then switch focus. Tantalizing or irritating? 

In other news, I’ve developed a strong interest in home gin-brewing (or more plainly, vodka-infusing), which has spectacular results, but I cannot find juniper berries anywhere. The horror!
