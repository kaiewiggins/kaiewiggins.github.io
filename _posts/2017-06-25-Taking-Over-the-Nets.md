So I must be overdue for an update; it's been over a month! *Cue gasp, nervous laughter.*

Aaaaanyways... It's about two weeks before I get the (hopefully last!) round of editorial back, and it's been a busy month of book promotions and getting back in the freelancing swing of things. US exchange sucks when I have to pay my consultants, but rocks when I'm the one benefitting from it, lol.

Some cool stuff emerging on the book promo front; I've finally (!!) launched a newsletter. If you [sign up](http://eepurl.com/cSevwn) you get the current freebie (extended preview of Blind the Eyes in Ebook or Audiobook formats), and any future freebies. I've got lots of ideas for supplementary novellas, so if I can keep those spoiler-free and under 80k words (lol), that'll probably be the next freebie. Also doing extended updates and top recommended reads in the newsletter. A lot of indie authors in particular do cross-promotion or newsletter swaps, which is where you agree to promote someone else's book in exchange for them putting it in their newsletter or on other platforms... which is nice and probably super effective, but I don't like the idea of just upselling some product I don't personally know much about, so I'm going to focus more on book reviews and if a handful of indies or Canadian authors make it into the mix, all the better. But no spam, I promise!

And once I'd made up the pretty ebooks and audiobooks for my newsletter subscribers, I realized it would be super easy and a great trial run to make a shorter version and toss it up on all the major ebook stores, so you can now get a (just) 3 chapter Limited Preview Edition of Blind the Eyes on Amazon, iTunes, Nook and Kobo as well!

So the other cool thing about doing that work, besides pretty, pretty files out there for you all, is that I was able to get all of it up on Goodreads, so you can now [Follow me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/kaiespace) or on my [Amazon author profile](http://amazon.com/author/kawiggins) for notifications through those platforms whenever I publish something new. And, like, reviews n'stuff. Plus I'm pretty sure there'll be some ARC copies coming along one of these days... So yeah, check it out 'n give me a follow there!
