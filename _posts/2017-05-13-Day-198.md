Itâ€™s terrible for measurable progress and productivity, but the best thing Iâ€™ve found to do while working on plot and creative changes to the book map, themes, character arcs etc. is toâ€¦ not work. Itâ€™s a very delicate balance, though. Too much time away from it, and I make no forward momentum. But stepping away for five minutes, or twenty, to watch a movie or take a bath or read a book, or even just sit down and sketch seems to give my brain the breathing room it needs to solve seemingly impossible problems.

The downside being that I keep coming up with more stuff to weave in which may or may not actually get me closer to being done and having a cohesive, appealing finished product. And also it keeps taking me longer to do things than I think. But in case anyone wondered, thatâ€™s why I canâ€™t do much freelancing or work a traditional job or even hang out with people or pursue hobbies and write on the side; the creative problem solving doesnâ€™t have enough space to work.

Thinking of tilting the direction for Cole (againâ€¦) Even though the â€˜romance quotientâ€™ seems to grow with each draft, itâ€™s never felt like the central element to me (despite the demands of genre conventionsâ€¦) So, although Cole explores what she thinks and wants out of a relationship with Ravel, with Itri, to a certain extent even with Cass, itâ€™s never that important or central to her. What is core is her relationship with Cadence, which major spoiler of course, is her. So itâ€™s really all identity, knowing and reconciling with oneselfâ€¦ but then theyâ€™re very different characters in the first book especially, so it comes off more as a sister or friend story of trust and rivalry. But I kind of like the girlsâ€™ relationship being the key element of the story, rather than the guy stuff. Even though dark fantasy and coming of age both dictate romance.

So thatâ€™ll be something to explore. But I keep coming up with cool ideas and then struggling to weave them inâ€¦ and I still donâ€™t really get how to do character development with only one POV, so thereâ€™s thatâ€¦ and apparently subtlety just ended up making everything confusing for readers, but itâ€™s not good to explain too much, and also Cole needs to be more of a proactive character with more challenges to struggle against in order to move the plot forward. So basically can there be more action, less reflecting and a shorter word count? Man, if it werenâ€™t a sure ticket to poverty, I really ought to have gone into literary fictionâ€¦
