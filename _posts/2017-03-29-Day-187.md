In typical fashion, immediately after hyper-productivity, I get next to nothing done. Which is cool and all; I had a few hours alone in the house, so a little indulgence was in order. And not entirely true; ended up doing quite a bit of marketing research. Interesting that it is actually possible to have hardcovers printed up. Yet another thing to debateâ€¦ Also saw some numbers on Kindle Publishing - yikes! In around $10K in one year isâ€¦ better than a few hundred dollers/not earning out outsourced investment, but stillâ€¦ absolutely no one is living off this stuff, even the â€˜successâ€™ stories, which is insane when you think about how much work, time, money etc. goes in. Learned a little on how to get books into distribution for stores, and in particular, libraries, so thatâ€™s a promising leadâ€¦ and considering staying in this location, or Canada at least, until after publication, which opens up better doors for promotion and sales, but is of course a huge about-faceâ€¦

Curious about the sound equipment coming in next week and if thatâ€™ll prove to open any doors or add any value. Iâ€™m seeing some stuff that reiterates the value of video for younger segments of the population, which is a terrifying thought, and came across a platform where you submit query letters to agents. Though itâ€™s yet another distraction, I think Iâ€™ll muck around in that world for a bit too. YA seems to be one of those borderline things where the value of going Indie and e-book-first is questionable, and apparently some agents do work with Indies and feel like they can both provide and receive enough value in that to make a go of it.
