Yesterday was pretty much a wash, and todayâ€™s not looking great either, but in the interest of not just totally dropping out of writing to nurse a cold, Iâ€™ll see if I canâ€™t generate a little something while being hit by fever-induced hot flashes. Who knows, it could be the greatest writing yet! 

In other news, my first giveaway experiment doesnâ€™t seem to be of interest, but my new FB page is doing not terrible, and by that I mean that sharing it as myself not only got a little interest from FB friends, but thereâ€™s some other mystery folks following too, so thatâ€™s a plus. Will have to think about some custom content for it as it grows and experiment with what sort of interactions generate interest.

Another thought that I really donâ€™t have time for right now; I wonder if I could rally some other indie authors, debut or otherwise, and put together a sort of compilation book as a giveaway, incentive sort of deal? First chapters of all debut books or short stories around a theme or something? Might be more work than its worth, but I keep hearing about the value of alliances and cross-promotion, and thereâ€™s a potentially altruistic bent that appeals to meâ€¦ of course, it would be better if Iâ€™d just get into a writers group and make some actual connections firstâ€¦

Also put in a proposal on a fairly significant SEO copywriting project that could generate income for next month. I feel like my chances arenâ€™t great, since it was posted on a network thatâ€™s mostly full of low-rate second-language freelancers, but hey, it was good practice in writing proposals, since itâ€™s been a while (lol). Yet another thing I need to get on; start bidding on projects for next month so my entire income isnâ€™t riding on a book that Iâ€™ve yet to actually publish!
