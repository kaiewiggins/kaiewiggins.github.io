My brother is getting married in three weeks. It’s a wonderful excuse for distraction. 

It also means that I inevitably confront the questions of good relationships. How does attraction work? What makes a good match? How can people choose to be together when they’re so different? 

I don’t really want to write romance as a main focus of any story, partly because I can’t relate, but questions of attraction, gender-based power and influence, and healthy/unhealthy relationships are surfacing in Cole’s story. 

It seems to be a key element of human existence; I can’t figure out how to inhabit Cole’s world without these threads coming out.
