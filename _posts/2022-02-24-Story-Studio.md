It's been another few whirlwind months in writing land and, uh, the rest of the world, too. Wild times!

Popping in today to say I'm excited to be leading a discussion on writing YA speculative (/fantasy) for the teen writers group of Story Studio tonight! I LOVE chatting with teen writers, and so rarely get the chance (so much programming is targeted for younger age groups, for some reason.)

In the spirit of transparency, ease of access, and making life easier for all of us, here are my slides/notes: [**Students, access slides/notes here!**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BVds0lJJfzqRygWDXpN2UHuvN-bgF40VQRBS7VeLuuM/edit?usp=sharing)

If you're not familiar with Story Studio, they're a Victoria (BC)-based charity that provides free and low cost writing programming, resources, and contests for kids and teens across Canada. [Check out their site for all the awesome details!](https://www.storystudio.ca/)
