## Write on Bowen Festival of Readers & Writers

**Date:** Sunday, September 17, 2023

**Time:** 1:30-3:30 pm

**Location:** The Hearth on Bowen Island, BC

**Type:** Workshop: "Choosing a Publishing Path"

Learn from the past, peer into the future, and define your personal motivations and publishing goals with this whirlwind workshop on how best to share your creativity with the right audiences.

We'll hash out the dreams (and unspoken assumptions) we bring to publishing, take a quick tour through publishing history, and survey the (many!) current and emerging publishing pathways available to us (including traditional, independent/self-publishing, hybrid, short, serial, pre-professional, & more) in order to match them up to our personal and professional goals.

We'll finish with a review of next steps toward the most common publishing pathways, and Q&A.

Spaces are (very!) limited and early bird pricing ends July 14â€”[learn more & register here.](https://www.writeonbowen.com/kawiggins)
