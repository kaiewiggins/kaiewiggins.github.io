So we’ll have to see how this goes. Took it pretty easy (somewhat/kinda/sorta) over the weekend, feeling like I needed more of a break to refuel and have the creativity to get through the critical ending this week… but then spent most of the time on marketing stuff, getting FB, website & that giveaway up and running, though I may have missed the mark anyways with it, and couldn’t fall asleep until after 3am and now I’m either coming down with a cold or allergies are hitting as hard as one so yeah, plan: rest & recharge was kinda a failure. But! I’m feeling moderately clearheaded at the moment, it’s quiet, and I’m committed. Let’s do this thing!
