I've been invited to speak at the Orchids Literary Fest in Mumbai!

It's being held April 18-20 at Orchids The International School, Malad campus, so if you're in the area, come say hi. :)

It's a children's literature fest (hosted at a school, after all), but there will be panels, workshops, and opportunities to connect across various storytelling mediums and for all ages. Plus, it's free to attend!

I'll update when the full schedule has been pinned down, but so far there are local and international actors, dancers, visual artists, and—of course—writers scheduled.
