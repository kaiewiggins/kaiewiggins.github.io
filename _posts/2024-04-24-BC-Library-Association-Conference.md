## BC Library Association Conference

**Date:** Wednesday & Thursday, Apr. 24-25, 2024

**Time:** 2:45-3:30 pm, Thursday, Apr. 25 (panel)

**Location:** Exhibitor's Hall & Salon E (panel), Pinnacle Hotel Harbourfront, 1133 W Hastings St, Vancouver

**Type:** Panel: "AMA Author (& Illustrator) Edition: Brush up on all things publishing!"

Panel description: "Three multi-awarded authors (& illustrator!) join forces to answer your burning questions about all things publishing, literacy connection/education & storytelling! Our panel collectively has over three decades of experience in writing, illustrating and publishing (traditional & indie/self-publishing), and also speak out of their experience leading literacy, creative writing, and publishing nonprofits. From how books get made to the current state of the industry, a day-in-the-life of creatives to behind-the-scenes on the other side of the page, creative writing education and public speaking to translating an idea into pictures, pages or screen, no subject is off limits in this free-for-all Ask-Me-Anything panel."

I'll be joined by Lee Edward FÃ¶di and Emily Seo for the panel, with Nikki Bergstresser, Jane Whittingham, and Kari Rust joining us for for author signings in the exhibitor's hall. Be sure to get your name in for the book prize draws!
