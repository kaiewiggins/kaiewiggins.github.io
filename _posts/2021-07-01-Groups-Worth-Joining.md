Facebook turns out to be an unexpectedly essential hotspot of groups for writers. Here are some worth your time:

- [Indie Author Support](https://www.facebook.com/groups/213952985607957)
- [20 Books to 50K](https://www.facebook.com/groups/20Booksto50k/)
- [Wide for the Win](https://www.facebook.com/groups/wideforthewin/)

You'll also find groups for every interest, purpose, or subset thereof (age range, genre, marketing topic, etc.)
