## Surrey Teachers' Association Convention

**Date:** Friday, May 2, 2025

**Time:** 12:45 pm + exhibitor's hall

**Location:** École Salish Secondary, Surrey

**Type:** Workshop

**Teaching Current Canadian Short Fiction to Today’s (& Tomorrow’s) Teens** 

Workshop description: Struggling to haul classes through novel studies? Classics getting stale? Tap into the power of short fiction to engage, surprise, and amaze with a fresh Canadian twist.

New Canadian short fiction explores current events and concerns, provides ample (award-winning!) material for literary analysis and inspiration, and does it all in a bite-sized package (usually with some fun thrown in!) 

Learn how to stay up to date and where to look for new material, pick up a recommended reading list of recent faves, and get an internationally practicing creative educator and multi-awarded BC writer’s insight into teaching short fiction to inspire the next generation of literature!

Be sure to visit our CWILL BC YA & Teen books table in the exhibition hall, or visit the CWILL presentations (Read Local, Teach Local & LEGO Storytelling, 10:15) and table at the elementary focus site (Sullivan Heights)!
