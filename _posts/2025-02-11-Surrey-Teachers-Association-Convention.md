## Surrey Teachers' Association Convention

**Date:** Friday, May 2, 2025

**Time:** TBA + exhibitor's hall

**Location:** Sullivan Heights Secondary & École Salish Secondary, Surrey

**Type:** Workshop & Presentation

**Teaching Current Canadian Short Fiction to Today’s (& Tomorrow’s) Teens** (École Salish Secondary, time TBA)

Workshop description: Struggling to haul classes through novel studies? Classics getting stale? Tap into the power of short fiction to engage, surprise, and amaze with a fresh Canadian twist.

New Canadian short fiction explores current events and concerns, provides ample (award-winning!) material for literary analysis and inspiration, and does it all in a bite-sized package (usually with some fun thrown in!) 

Learn how to stay up to date and where to look for new material, pick up a recommended reading list of recent faves, and get a multi-awarded BC writer’s insight into teaching short fiction to inspire the next generation of literature!


**Read Local, Teach Local: Connecting with BC Children's Authors & Illustrators** (Sullivan Heights, time TBA)

Presentation description: BC children’s publishing is growing increasingly diverse, relevant, and socially conscious. We're excited to highlight established award-winners and emerging voices with a broad range of teachable, impactful, and fun titles.

We'll start with an overview of the power of creative education and local storyteller engagement and highlight the growing range of free tools and resources offered by CWILL BC. Then a lightning-speed showcase of new releases will feature a sprinkling of mini book-talk pop-ups by local authors highlighting diverse creators and place-based, sustainability, and social justice-oriented titles.

Meet local authors, refresh your shelves, and get inspired for the year ahead (& maybe even win a new book or two)!

Presented by Sara Leach & Nikki Bergstresser. Additional pop-up book talk guests (local/BC authors/illustrators) to be announced.

Be sure to visit our tables in the exhibition halls and get your name in for the book prize draws!
