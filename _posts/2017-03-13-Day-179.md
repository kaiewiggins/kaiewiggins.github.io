Time change is an evil, evil invention that ought to be erased from human existence. 

In other news, I hired a cover artist! Which Iâ€™m kinda panicking about b/c itâ€™s yet another significant investment that Iâ€™ve got to make worthwhile, and Iâ€™ve had several days of not being that productive and still have some concerns over the plot coherency, but panic is apparently my natural state. 

Reading Sarah J. Maasâ€™ A Court of Mist and Fury and impressed with the incredible (feminist) character growth, despite how much I *donâ€™t* agree with some of her premises. And feeling inadequate, yet again, as a result, lol. I really admire the messiness of Feyreâ€™s character, but I struggle to tell a coherent and inspiring story without making it too simplistic. Or incoherently full of every possible thing. Tried to spend some more time on plot today, but between Monday-ness and time-changeless and a death in the extended family and travel planning getting closer and all, I basically made no progress. Also, I only just figured out (yesterday) that the Christian perspective on women and specifically women in the church, is a massive mostly un-grounded mess, so thatâ€™s been fun. Lol. You think youâ€™ve mastered the critical thinking stuff, and then you find gaping holes that youâ€™ve conveniently just taken on board. Yeah. Awesome. So thereâ€™s that. 

But mostly Iâ€™m just feeling lazy and distracted and dissatisfied, and having trouble thinking coherent thoughts, which doesnâ€™t translate well to brilliant writing. Oh well, back at it, for what thatâ€™s worth!
