So my major accomplishment yesterday was rereading the editorial report and Googling forms of headcoverings for a couple hours, lol. It really feels like past time to tweak the terminology and world building to be a little more meaningful than just upper case versions of mundane nouns, so, yeah. And also anything that needed researching to flesh out, itâ€™s really time to get on that. But itâ€™s also a form of procrastination, in that Iâ€™m trying to digest suggestions, wrap my head around the story again after a month away, and generally work my way back up to some forward momentum. 

Watched the final Sherlock episode yesterday, which was inspiring from a drama-storytelling perspective. I think the villain in particular offers some characteristics to both Serovate and Ravel. Moriartyâ€™s tics and over-expressiveness just the wrong side of appealing are so creepily weird. Iâ€™m insecure about my villains, since I have a track record of not writing them well, and Iâ€™ve never liked them much. At least the editorial feedback really affirmed that I fixed the structural and plot issues around having the villains/antagonists hanging around in the background without doing enough. Actually, on a second reading, I do feel more confident in the upcoming rewrites. Everything always seems so overwhelming at first, and then I just have to grit my teeth and dive in and make it to the other side. So, here goes nothing! Plan of attack:

* Terminology issues: find-replace for all terms that need updating
* Plot issues: address items of confusion
* Pacing issues: condense or expand indicated scenes
* Language issues: rewrites/review edits to slow/speed pacing as necessary, improve power and clarity
