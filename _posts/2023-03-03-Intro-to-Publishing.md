## Abbotsford Arts Council Presents Workshop Wednesday: Intro to Publishing

**Date:** Wednesday, February 8, 2023

**Time:** 6pm

**Location:** Online

**Type:** Workshop/Presentation, Q&A

Join us for the second webinar in Abbotsford Arts Council's Workshop Wednesday series! I'll be taking attendees through a whirlwind overview of all things publishingâ€“local visibility, in-person sales and ecommerce as a publishing strategy, as well as planning, drafting, editing, product design/development, launching, pre and post-launch marketing, sales & PR, with time for a Q & A at the end.

This webinar is perfect for local writers looking to learn more about the world of publishing and getting their work from their screens to the shelves. Learn more and register at the [Abbotsford Arts Council website](https://abbotsfordartscouncil.com/workshop-wednesday-intro-to-publishing/).

And check back later for more great local artist resources from AAC. I'll be offering an asynchronous, multi-part marketing and cover design workshop before the end of March, and there's more on the way!
