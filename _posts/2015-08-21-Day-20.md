I can’t sleep (too much coffee?), and I’ve been writing lines in my head, so I may as well get them out. The world rotates a bit when I move, but that’s perfect. 

I’m going to write the trip through the darkness and the flying/falling dream that’s Cole’s first brush with the dream death. Ideally suited to the small hours of the night and silent darkness. 

Although, I’m really channeling emo for this… could be too much!
