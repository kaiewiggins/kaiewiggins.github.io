The redirection is set; a third round of developmental edit starts Monday and runs to the end of the first week of July. Iâ€™m (just barely) on track to finish substantial rewrites today, covering the major climax and closing, which may be a big job and leech into tomorrow if I get stuck/tired. However, part of the course redirect is some paperwork to fill out around concept and plot, so Iâ€™d like to get that out tomorrow, as well as a final pass at the editorial comments to ensure everythingâ€™s been dealt with as comprehensively and neatly as possible. Interestingly enough, my editor seems surprised at how much rewriting and replotting I do between rounds, which shocks me in turn, as I canâ€™t imagine resolving the things she points out with only minor adjustments. So either thatâ€™s insecurity making my life difficult, or or change my mind about what Iâ€™m trying to accomplish drastically every couple monthsâ€¦ which seems probable, actually.

So, second week of July to review final report and come up with any additional changes, then about two weeks to hash out a strong query letter and synopsis, and that leaves only two months (Aug-Sep) for querying agents before I need to kick things back into gear for self publishing if I want to target the holidays at the end of November. I may extend the timeline slightly, publishing for the following June, but I really canâ€™t let it sit any longer.

Here we go; last 5 chapters (fingers crossed!)
