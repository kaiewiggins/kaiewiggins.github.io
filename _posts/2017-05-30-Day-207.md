Overnight musings for todayâ€™s rewrites: pull back on the whole romance angle with Ash; itâ€™s not really natural. Cole can maybe experience some jealousy, curiosity etc., but she probably canâ€™t navigate or at least admit to herself the whole attraction/falling in love thing. Maybe lean into her being interested in Ash as a â€˜saviourâ€™, his driven-ness, ability appeal to her. Also, I only just worked out: Cole & Ash. (Coal & Ash). Itâ€™s like before & after, fuel and remnant, but neither is flame. I wonder if Iâ€™m going somewhere with that, or if itâ€™s just a coincidenceâ€¦ the subconscious is a scary and wonderful place, kids.

In other news, it was a hard slog, but I did manage to get back on my 5 chapter/day schedule yesterday with a huge push to chapter 40, which puts me back on target to reach the end (ch60) by Friday with a couple days to spare for the inevitable overflow. In hindsight, I should have been a little less freaked by pushing the schedule along and left myself two months for this phase, but then again, itâ€™s been good motivation and I canâ€™t afford to just keep pushing the publishing date back forever and not making money. Interesting to realize that Rin Chupeco is a self-published; need to do some digging and see how sheâ€™s done it and where sheâ€™s at. Her latest book (The Bone Witch) looks miles ahead of her first two in terms of design and also marketing buzz, IG bookstagram posts etc., so it seems like sheâ€™s worked her way up to that point, but Iâ€™m impressed that sheâ€™s done it within three books or so, and has wide library circulation etc. Gives me some hope, after the disappointment of Melissa Marrâ€™s One Blood Ruby. Poorly proofread with typos and awkward language choices in several spots. Seems like her publisher is maybe pulling the best resources back, which is brutal to see after a successful launch series and several additional books out there, all quite enjoyable and brilliant. Itâ€™s a terrible field that way, especially, it seems, in YA where thereâ€™s always a new trend and debut author to look at.

Part 2

So yeah, 2 hours just for review and minimal changes, but I think doing it this way is going to be better than trying for a last minute lightning edit the day before deadline. Little bit brutal facing up to a five chapter window starting, well, now, but hey, if thatâ€™s what it takesâ€¦ Cross my fingers that edits on this segment are minimal and easier to whip through!!
