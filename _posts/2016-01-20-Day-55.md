So apparently the only people who actually do online dating are based out of Algeria and South America. Not so helpful, unless I wanted to write Cole a long distance stalker with poor language skills but much persistence. 

Hmm… Actually, I could probably use that somehow… Anyways. 

I feel like Silver’s ending up as kind of a weird person. If I ever share my first draft of their story, you see this near-godlike heroic figure that sweeps out of nowhere and overturns Cole’s life. 

But then, Cole started out as quite a different person, in a different world, so I guess it all kind of works. Sometimes I’m sad that that original story will never grow and be told, but then I remember that how I got here was leaning into that story and, on closer inspection, finding out it was this one. 

Nevertheless, Silver/Mist/Itri is turning out much less cool and much more fallible than I wanted or expected. Lily’s showing extreme empathy and resourcefulness for her age, which is also worrying. 

On the plus side, they’ve got a plan and now I know what to write next, so there’s that.
