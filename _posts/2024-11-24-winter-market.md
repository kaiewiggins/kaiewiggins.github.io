## Art Is Love Is Resistance: A Winter Market for Refugee Children

**Date:** Saturday, December 7, 2024

**Time:** 12-5 pm 

**Location:** Buchanan Hall, Cumberland, BC

**Type:** Vendor Market

I've just relocated and will have *very* limited stock of the *Threads of Dreams* series in paperback available for saleâ€”but I'm also pulling together a table full of other local kidlit authors and illustrators for all your holiday shopping needs!

Look forward to an art auction, community art projects, craft stations, and live music, as well as the vendor market in support of a great cause. (No gate tickets/entry fee!)

Hosted by Comox Valley for Palestine, this event will be raising money for refugee children to receive art therapy at Meera Centre, an art therapy centre in Cairo, Egypt.
