I’m probably doing a terrible job on the writing side, but it feels great once I’m actually in Cole’s world. 

Marathoned <a href="http://blackholly.com">Holly Black’s</a> latest book <a  href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00K5UNWV4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=390961&creativeASIN=B00K5UNWV4&linkCode=as2&tag=kaie06-20">The Darkest Part of the Forest</a><img src="http://ir-ca.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kaie06-20&l=as2&o=15&a=B00K5UNWV4" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 last night (sleepy), and in her end notes she mentions the doubt and frustration of feeling like it’s just not going to come together or be ok, so I guess if #1 NYT bestselling authors feel that way, I’ve still got a shot. 

Just keep moving forward, even if it’s slow, even if I feel lazy, even if it’s possibly terrible and a waste of time. 

I could stop, but if doesn’t feel like an option. I couldn’t leave Cole and everyone hanging like that…

I other news, I got a sweet Squier Strat yesterday. So yeah, some motivation there for getting to work and knocking off to-do items from my schedule today so I can start rockin’ out. Would be nice to make rock star before the green hair grows out (bleach=boredom).
