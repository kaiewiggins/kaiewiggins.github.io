## Pop-Up Book Sale

**Date:** December 11, 2021

**Time:** 4pm - 7pm PST 

**Location:** Academie Duello at 412 West Hastings, Vancouver, BC

**Type:** Book and Craft Sale + Live Reading 

Fantastic BC small press [Pulp Literature](https://pulpliterature.com/) is hosting a local author book (+craft+art) sale in the super cool and spacious Academie Duello swordplay school space in Gastown and you need to check it out!

It's open from 4-7 pm, and I'll be rushing over after my workshops end at 5 in Coquitlam, so come say hi if you're there after 6! My books will be stocked all event, and friends' books you should definitely also pick up while you're there include CWILLers [Bryce Raffle](http://www.bryceraffle.com/), [Cynthia Heinrichs](https://cynthiaheinrichsauthor.wordpress.com/), and [Ellen Schwartz](https://www.ellenschwartz.net/), plus Vancouver-area author [Tanya Lisle](https://tanyalisle.com/)! 

Masks and vaccine passports will be required. It's a large space, so crowding shouldn't be an issue. 

RSVP on the [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/events/975573233365483/?acontext=%7B%22event_action_history%22%3A[%7B%22mechanism%22%3A%22calendar_tab_event%22%2C%22surface%22%3A%22bookmark_calendar%22%7D]%2C%22ref_notif_type%22%3Anull%7D) to help vendors get a sense of how much stock to supply and check out more vendor profiles as they drop over the coming weeks. Hope to see you there! :D
