My debut novel, *Blind the Eyes*, dropped June 1, 2018. It's been an absolute whirlwind of a ride ever since. Some things I'd hoped for never turned out; other things I'd never even dreamed of came out of the woodwork.

I'd planned to mark the occasion with something small—a new cover for Under, my subscriber-exclusive series prequel novella. Maybe a little giveaway.

But the redesign looked so awesome, I couldn't help myself:

So, yeah, buckle up for a complete series relaunch:

- A brand-new trilogy collection "box set" ebook drops June 1. ([Get the collection here](https://books2read.com/threadsofdreams))
- The new edition of *Blind the Eyes* launches the same day. ([Get the new BTE edition here.](https://books2read.com/thread1))
- *Black the Tides* is scheduled for July 6. ([Preorder here.](https://books2read.com/thread2))
- *Burn the Skies* will relaunch in August (Links coming soon.)
- and the short fiction titles will hit stores throughout the fall (but newsletter subscribers can grab their copies now!) ([Subscribe here.](https://mailchi.mp/7852e61cb116/ka-wiggins-ya-dystopian-dark-fantasy-newsletter))

Thanks for your patience as I work through these updates—pages and links might be a little wonky in the transition (and the reason everything doesn't drop June 1 is there's a ton of work on the backend to get all the pieces in play.)

Also, don't miss the giveaway!
