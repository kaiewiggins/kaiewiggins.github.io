My debut novel, *Blind the Eyes*, dropped June 1, 2018. It's been an absolute whirlwind of a ride ever since. Some things I'd hoped for never turned out; other things I'd never even dreamed of came out of the woodwork.

I'd planned to mark the occasion with something small—a new cover for Under, my subscriber-exclusive series prequel novella. Maybe a little giveaway.

But the redesign looked so awesome, I couldn't help myself:

So, yeah, buckle up for a complete series relaunch:

- A brand-new trilogy collection "box set" ebook drops June 1 [get the collection](https://books2read.com/threadsofdreams)
- The new edition of *Blind the Eyes* launches the same day [get the new BTE edition](https://books2read.com/thread1)
- *Black the Tides* is scheduled for July 6
- *Burn the Skies* will relaunch in August
- and the short fiction titles will hit stores throughout the fall (but newsletter subscribers can grab their copies now!)[Subscribe here]()

Thanks for your patience as I work through these updates—pages and links might be a little wonky in the transition (and the reason everything doesn't drop June 1 is there's a ton of work on the backend to get all the pieces in play.)

And check back before June 1 for details on the 5th Anniversary Giveaway!
