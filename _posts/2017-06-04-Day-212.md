Itâ€™s always terrifying looking back at the last dayâ€™s work, especially when I think Iâ€™ve done something brilliant, something that had flow or inspiration attached, mainly due to the risk that Iâ€™ll discover it was useless tripe that needs to be redone. â€˜Cause thatâ€™s never happened beforeâ€¦

Anyways. Working through the plot in another format proved to be the right move, even if it was retreading ground Iâ€™ve passed over before. Iâ€™d like to think that Iâ€™d be smarter next time, more efficient, more streamlinedâ€¦ but Iâ€™m suspicious that the process has to be like this, iterative, a redoing and rehearsing, a niggling of elements and thoughts and tiny and great changes again and again and againâ€¦ Or maybe Iâ€™ve just been making trouble for myself. Hard to say. Either way, it seemed to finally come together this time. I was able to state the story in as close to brief point form as I ever have done. Thereâ€™s an arc, a continuity of motivation and resolution that I couldnâ€™t quite purify out of the mass of complexity before. Irritatingly, itâ€™s at the final hour, so the actual draft probably still has a great deal of confusing, but part of the trouble all along has been that I refuse to simplify right down to a single motive force. Thereâ€™s always more complexity in people, in stories, in life, than that. However, distilling and teasing out the main story thread for readers is almost beyond me; itâ€™s in there, but making it easy to see amongst all the words and switchbacks and angst in general isâ€¦ well, it may or may not have actually happened. Planning to review the plot and story forms today, do a last scan over the last 10 chapters to refine things one last time, and I should probably go through and do a form for every scene, or even macro scene (shudders), but weâ€™ll see. The appeal of just shipping it all off to the editor is immense at this point, but if Iâ€™ve learned one thing, itâ€™s that, indispensable as they are, editors are not magic and they donâ€™t do all (or, really, any) of the work for you. Such disappointment. Sigh. 

Iâ€™ve written these things several times now, the â€˜here we go againâ€™ and â€˜thank goodness itâ€™s doneâ€™ journal entries. This wonâ€™t be the last - but itâ€™s bittersweet and painful and joyous each time. Itâ€™s nearly done. I have a list of dozens of things to accomplish this month, at least two thirds of which, if past lists are anything to go by, wonâ€™t even come close to getting done. I need to freelance and make money. Thereâ€™s that stupid side business that I should really actually launch. I need to record an audiobook preview of BtE and get it up as a newsletter incentive - and get back on track with the marketing and platform building. I really ought to plot out the BtE sequel and my sadly neglected Wattpad WIP pile as well, but most likely Iâ€™ll try to see friends and family, maybe get a tiny bit of a breather, angst about turning 30 because thereâ€™s a whole new load of trauma, and muddle around until the next deadline starts breathing down my neck. #writerslife, lol.
