Our authors and illustrators are offering virtual midweek sessions (schools, libraries, home learners etc. encouraged to tune in!), we'll be offering a children's activity center on Saturday, and hosting a table in the exhibitor's hall on Sunday. Stop by to say hi, grab some free bookmarks, and enter our giveaway!

I'll be on site all weekend helping out with free drop-in kids activities, running the CWILL BC table, and moderating the following events:

 - **Finding the Way in your City** A panel for Early Readers (roughly Kindergarten to Grade 3) featuring author-illustrator Kari Rust and Darren Lebeuf on Monday, September 19, 2022 from 9:30-10:15 am on Zoom: "Two authors share stories of kids discovering how to connect to their city and see places in a whole new light. In one case, a group of children befriend an older man and learn about the many fascinating older objects he holds onto in his house. In the other, a visually impaired young girl experiences the places around her through all her other senses, appreciating them in all their richness." **[Register Here!](https://www.wordvancouver.ca/childrens-events/2022/7/19/opening-of-word-vancouver-meet-our-curators-l7xhc-f53bk-nwxyz-f7ztr-lmet2-wpay7-afylm-hy7n9-5n3ww-rlgn9-62epa-hsxrf-rs2yy-55b6f-zy8dk-27ct5-whejt-77hm3)**

 - **Twists and Turns** A Reading/Conversation Circle for Middle Grade Readers (roughly grades 4–6) featuring Emily Seo and Bree Galbraith on Saturday, Sep. 24 at Surrey City Centre Library from 1-2 pm: "Life can be full of twists and turns especially when you’re trying to fit in, help family and friends, and ultimately find out who you are. Join these two authors as they share their characters’ unique ways of being true to themselves in a world full of questions and observations."

 - A panel on children's publishing (for aspiring writers/illustrators & kidlit fans) featuring Claire Lordon, Sara Leach, Bryce Raffle & Danielle S. Marcotte on Sunday, Sep. 25 at SFU Harbour Centre from 11:30-12:30
