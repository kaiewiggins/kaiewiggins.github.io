Gave notice on my Vancouver rental suite yesterday and spent the day registering and sending in samples to freelance sites. My first 150 word article (?) was rejected for not being what the buyer wanted; my rating is 3/5. If he had accepted the article, I would have made less than $2. So yeah, not the most productive or fulfilling day. 

Starting to wonder if I have any objectivity regarding my own writing abilities; am I just deluded and self-satisfied with objectively inadequate skills? 

That’s enough emo for today. Going to churn out some content and hope I’m the next big thing...
