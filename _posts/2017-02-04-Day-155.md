This morning I had myself convinced I was going to work today. Then it was a snowy Saturday morning and I decided to spoil myself and finish the second book in Maggie Stiefvaterâ€™s Raven Cycle. Then I had so many ideas from her cleverness that I was going to sit down and work on the book for the afternoon. Then I got distracted by Instagram and a couple hours went byâ€¦ and here I am deciding to at least get some work done. 

As usual, I am both inspired and depressed by reading other peopleâ€™s brilliance. And I my daily progress posts are lagging on IG, so itâ€™s clear not everyone is impressed by my brilliance, such as it is or is notâ€¦ Came across somebody just starting to create bookmarks and thinking if launching on Easy. I wonder if thereâ€™s a cross-promotion/partnership/commission thing there that I should pursue? Incentives forâ€¦ something. Joining a mailing list. Ordering. Pre-ordering. A well-known and popular creator would bring more reach, but would come with less flexibility and more expense (probably). Still feels too soon to worry about. And I donâ€™t even want to think about budgets and financing promotionsâ€¦ ugh.

In storytelling world, Iâ€™m still less than confident about my plot. Itâ€™s better (probably) than the original, but feels simultaneously too simplistic and too complex. Coleâ€™s more proactive, but the whole thing is so internalizedâ€¦ in Stiefvaterâ€™s books, she really confronts issues of wanting, what we want, when we donâ€™t know, when it hurts us, when we donâ€™t get it, but itâ€™s within a larger framework. Iâ€™m weak on the larger framework and deep into the internal character issues. Which is maybe the difference between a Stiefvater and a Yovanoff, but Iâ€™m worried that itâ€™s actually the difference between a pro and an amateur. So off I go to tangle myself up in my plot again and lose track of the ends of the string.

Part 2

Oof, itâ€™s hard working on a Friday. Or maybe itâ€™s just the stretch Iâ€™m working on or something. Slow going! I think Iâ€™m subconsciously (now consciously?) afraid of writing the big reveal bit with the Tower agents â€˜cause itâ€™s too thriller/mystery/grand reveal weighty. But on the ego-boosting side, someone on IG asked if I had anything up on Kindle, so thereâ€™s at least one person out there who might be willing to consider spending money for my words! Maybe Iâ€™m doing something right after all?
