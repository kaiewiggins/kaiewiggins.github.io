Still procrastinating on the travel plans; some exciting developments on the home front that could really impact the choices I makeâ€¦ although if past experience has anything to say about it, Iâ€™m likely to end up waiting around for ages and nothing much happening, lol. If things do go ahead, itâ€™ll take away from overall travel/digital nomadism fun, and also writing time, but offer more financial stability. Also, itâ€™ll be something very worth doing, so Iâ€™m tentatively excited about the prospect. But while itâ€™s interesting to think about, itâ€™s also a huge distraction from getting on with the writing, and Iâ€™m finishing this book darnit (and probably a few to several to dozens after itâ€¦) so onwards!

The trickle of IG love is still dripping along, which is a huge encouragement and motivation. Thanks again for the love guys; your comments, likes and messages really help me stay engaged, have hope and keep pushing forward! I worked some more on graphics last night, and Iâ€™m going to keep trying to pull together the last few threads to get that giveaway up and running as soon as I possibly can!

But yeah, focus is hard, yâ€™all. In more good news, I think Iâ€™m moving toward the end at a good clip and may only have a third to a quarter of this draft left to write! â€¦the bad news being, plot-wise I only just hit the midpoint, so something about the balance is a bit iffy (lol). I really hope I donâ€™t have 50% left to write thoughâ€¦
