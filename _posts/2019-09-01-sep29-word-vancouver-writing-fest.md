## WORD Vancouver Writing Festival

**Date:** September 29, 2019

**Time:** 10am-5pm

**Location:** Central Library Branch, Plaza (350 West Georgia St., Vancouver, BC)

**Type:** Book Fair, Writing Festival

I'll be staffing the [CWILL BC](https://www.cwillbc.org/) exhibitor's table at this year's [WORD Vancouver](https://www.wordvancouver.ca/) festival all day, so drop by to learn more about what we offer for BC-based authors and illustrators of children's books, or pick up a great new local picture book, chapter book, middle grade or YA novel and get it signed on the spot!
