With huge thanks to the Vancouver Public Library's free creator spaces, I was able to spend a week recording *Blind the Eyes* in Vancouver. 20 hours later, I have raw files and a mountain of audio editing ahead, but audiobooks are *finally* underway!

Also: I've been accepted as a member and registered as a speaker with the Children's Writers and Illustrators of British Columbia Society (CWILL BC). Looking forward to learning, building connections, giving back to the community, and hopefully getting out to see more awesome readers and the next generation of writers!

If you're an event organizer or a reader lobbying local events to bring in more authors you like, [here's my speaker profile on CWILL BC](https://www.cwillbc.org/Member_View.aspx?MemberID=82980) for reference. I'd love to meet you!
