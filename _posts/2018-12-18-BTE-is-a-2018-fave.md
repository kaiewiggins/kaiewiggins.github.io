So excited to announce that Barnes & Noble Press have just named *Blind the Eyes* as one of their top "20 Favourite Indie Books of 2018"!!

Here's what they had to say about it:

"Why we loved it: A unique twist on the YA-dystopian genre, Wiggins weaves a complex tale that unfolds like a dream itself â€” mystical, and sometimes odd, but always captivating."

Thanks guys!
