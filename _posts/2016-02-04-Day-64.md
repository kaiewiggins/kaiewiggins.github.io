This whole week has felt like blah~~ …but I’ve made decent headway regardless, which is reassuring. 

Starting rewrites was less than encouraging, and I’m debating between intensifying rewrite efforts and holding off so that I can keep up the forward momentum. 

Probably not going to get much extra done this week - it’s chore day, and I have a small freelance project to turn over - but I think next week is the last clear one before vacation, and I’m still not sure if I’m going to keep plugging through the two weeks of vacation, or if I’ll devolve into an unproductive, Netflix or Crunchyroll-addicted lump and hide from the world for the full two weeks. 

Decisions, decisions! 

In terms of value for followers, also not sure that all the material I had thought of sharing will make it up. This journal-blog, for one, is probably not terribly valuable for anyone but true obsessives, but maybe if I offered a platform? Build the tools, and then get other writers to use them? Or something… 

All assuming I’m as clever as I think I am, and can actually code anything useful… 

Future problems are for the future. 

Leave it alone…
