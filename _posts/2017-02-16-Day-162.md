Progress; despite struggling to just sit down and work, dammit, Iâ€™m pushing forward again with the draft. Getting closer and closer to the point that I run out of content to recycle, but thatâ€™s not necessarily a bad thing, as the word count seems to run about the same regardless of whether itâ€™s fresh or edited. Still not totally happy with Ravelâ€™s treatment; I think he needs to be more sympathetic and appealing, but Cole and Cadenceâ€™s reactions to him are so wary early on that it tips the hand against him. Recycling content is a little bit dangerous in that I slip into the flow of things and itâ€™s hard to break it up and insert the meaningful changes that inform the plot direction and fresh characterization since the original draft, but sometimes Iâ€™m so in love with my own words that it seems a real shame to just let them wither in obscurity (lol).

I think this early middle section (life in Freedom) is running the risk of being too low on Coleâ€™s motivation and too high on world building, which may feel slow and unexciting to readers despite the inherent interest in the new setting and situation, so thatâ€™s something to circle back to and enhance. Gonna try to keep pushing forward on the same basis; review/refresh/edit last two chapters or so, then push forward two (or more? #goalsâ€¦) chapters. 

Baby visitation over the weekend, so my actual work days are getting squeezed somewhat - all the more reason to buckle down and produce while I can! Itâ€™s bizarre to feel like I should be holding a baby, when itâ€™s so new and totally unnecessary; there are other people to do that, after all, but it does feel like, I donâ€™t know, like my arms are empty a lot or something. Which is hilarious, â€˜cause Iâ€™ve held him for maybe total 20 minutes in his life, lol. Itâ€™s pretty cool to see family and stuff in action though; just the reality that something, someone can be so intrinsically precious without doing or being anything of their own volition. So yeah. Stuff n thingsâ€¦

Part 2

Man, itâ€™s almost kind of pointless trying to get started in the morning; so many interruptions! And I just hit 1K followers on my bookstagram/IG account, so then I did a follow train and asked about giveaway preferences to gear up for the first one, so then Iâ€™ve been busy with that for like an hour setting it up and responding etc. So yeah, slow progress on the writing; slightly better on the marketing side! Must remember to ask questions in posts and interact more in future; great to have the feedback and I think it really builds more of a connection too! Market research, lol. Anyways, back at it!
