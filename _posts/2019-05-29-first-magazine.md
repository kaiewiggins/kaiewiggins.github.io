Just a quick update today: one of my stories got accepted by a literary (genre) magazine!

It might seem like a weird thing to get excited about at this point in my career, but it's actually a first for me. I've had short stories win contests, published short stories and had them licensed for translations, and published full a full novel, but I've never actually submitted a short story to a publication before.

Even more exciting, the story was picked up by the very first magazine I submitted to! They called it "exceptional and lyrically beautiful!"

You can read *On The Edge* in [Enchanted Magazine](https://enchantedconversationmag.blogspot.com)'s June 2019 edition. It's an NA horror/dark fantasy faery story about walking on water, adulthood & escaping reality in the Scottish Highlands and the ending is possibly one of my favourite things I've ever written.

Hidden paths and ancient ruins! Creatures beneath the waves! ALLLL the millennial angst. Very On Brand #monstersandmagic âœ¨

Also, it's inspired by my actual adventures in the UK. Up to you to guess which parts~
