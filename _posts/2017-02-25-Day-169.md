So yesterday actually went really well. Despite losing 3.5 hours on plot, I think it was worth it; Iâ€™m tightening things up, and really was able to get a better handle on the climax and how that ties things up. Unfortunately, I really need to backtrack and refine everything else now to support that ending, but at least now I have a clear(er) target to aim for. I seem to be bad at endings.

I also think Iâ€™ve still got too much of an â€˜internal developmentâ€™ thing going on with the plot and character arc. Character development is great, but without the external action, it gets too slow and literary-fiction-y, and as much as I kind of love doing things that way, its not what I love reading (at least, probably maybe notâ€¦? I like well plotted stuff as well as the weirdâ€¦) and Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s not what people want to read. Iâ€™m having a terrible time seeing where to make those changes, though, without just losing what Iâ€™ve created/the value of whatâ€™s been done/the uniqueness etc. Iâ€™d hoped that hiring an editor would really give me that insight and perspective to shape it appropriately, but Iâ€™m frustrated with the process. Obviously I donâ€™t have recent experience of what itâ€™s like with a major publisher, but the arrangement I have just doesnâ€™t seem close or allow for a great deal of back and forth. Thereâ€™s no â€˜getting-to-know-youâ€™ process, and Iâ€™m not clear on my editorâ€™s reading/familiarity in YA besides that she says she does itâ€¦ I have a feeling weâ€™re talking about different things a lot, but maybe Iâ€™m just being defensive about my work and not wanting to see what she tries to point outâ€¦

In any case, good things were done and I kept at it for 8+ hours between one thing and the other, which I think is record breaking for me, if we exclude research and marketing efforts. That also includes my serial chapter for Things Got Out of Hand, which I hammered out at the end of the night in no time flat, as if I were flying (or drunk, which I wasnâ€™t). I basically hopped up and down in place for a while after it was done, so jazzed and energized. The tone, the plot, the banter, it just flowed. So in the zone. And no, I donâ€™t want to think about how it took me like 7 hours to get thereâ€¦ but anyways, TGOoH is looking kinda supernatural rom-com at the moment, with bitchy antisocial sarcasm, so a bit like Sherlock (tv), now that I think of it, but less brilliant. Anyways, Iâ€™m feeling good about it, even though itâ€™s kinda directionless and steering super far away, yet again, from where I wanted to take it. I may need to just face up to the fact that I canâ€™t recapture, or more to the point, rewrite the story and feelings that I put into it as a teen. Iâ€™m just not in a place to do heartrendingly sweet romance. Plus, it was never a proper story, just a bit of a set-up. No tension. No issues. So Iâ€™d have to start from a different place, or use it as backstory or something to make that work (see, Iâ€™m learning! I may not be putting it into practice properly yet, but Iâ€™m learning!)

Which led into todayâ€™s marketing efforts. WAY too much time spent on IG again, and on browsing Etsy for bookish giveaway products. Thankfully or problematically, with everyone else out of the house, I could have Buffy the Vampire Slayer on in the background. Which contributed to me not actually doing any writing until 6 pm, but anywaysâ€¦ the good news is, I signed up my first person to my mailing list! Letâ€™s all stop and admire that triumph for a momentâ€¦ and then shake our heads at how long its taking me to actually get the rest of my book marketing rolling. Baby steps. Itâ€™s partly graphics; they take me forever, arenâ€™t shameful, but arenâ€™t stellar either, and hold me back from just getting stuff rolling. Maybe tomorrowâ€¦ but! Posting my daily updates continues to connect with a trickle of fans impressed with the innovative form and the content itself, and TGOoH made an impression today as well as BtE, so if I can keep it together and find the time while financially keeping my head above water, I may be able to publish 3 books in the next 12-15 months! Which could get me to the place in my publishing career that I need to be to pull this off! Although, I probably donâ€™t have a prayer of having enough funds to keep up that pace and will have to take a time-out to earn cashâ€¦ Still, itâ€™s a surprisingly hopeful place to be! Keep doing what Iâ€™m doing, and do it a little better, a little longer, and a little faster all the time, and I may make it! Assuming people donâ€™t hate my books once theyâ€™re out. Or ignore them. Orâ€¦

Right, better get on with the writing before I talk myself into a slump, lol. Anyways, Iâ€™ve been treating Sundays as a â€˜day of restâ€™ b/c commandments and gifts of God and creative renewal and general laziness and all that, but I also know a lot of writing advice really pushes the whole write every day thing, plus I am feeling that disconnect where I get my head into it, and then stop almost immediately, so marathon writing sessions might actually be good if I could pull them off. Anyways, Iâ€™m not going to try to write/rewrite BtE on Sundays, but Iâ€™m considering using them as marketing day (although that seems a little off - maybe more like creative (graphic) design day?) and also starting short story or micro fiction challenges, something short and differentâ€¦ Iâ€™m not sure if I can/should schedule myself every day with expectations, but I could really use some experience crafting complete story arcs, and I canâ€™t do 2-3 a year, so I need to get into shorter fiction for practice. I canâ€™t believe I just wrote that, but there it is. I think thatâ€™s the only way to really get a handle on the way I canâ€™t plot endings, or, you know, plots. So thereâ€™s that. One more thing to work into the rotation. Iâ€™ve been impressed at how motivating targets are; I stress about them, which leads to procrastinating, but I also meet them; I havenâ€™t missed a weekly serial release yet (there are 2), and that consistent 2-chapter thing in my daily updates on IG keeps me pushing longer than I otherwise would. What Iâ€™m not clear on is, do the additional targets take away from what I put into BtE, or do they exist in a separate place in my head and creative energy and stuff? Itâ€™s not like I work on BtE for ten hours a day or anything (not even closeâ€¦) So yeah, thoughts and stuff to doâ€¦
