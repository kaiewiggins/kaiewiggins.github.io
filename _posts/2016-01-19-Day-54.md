Day 54

<small>Contains affiliate links.</small> Officially past the 40K word mark! 

I’m gonna call that the halfway point (as if I know, lol), but it seems reasonable. 

Could be some exciting events coming up as the plot heats up (fingers crossed…) and the largest portion of the world building and character-building efforts are now behind us. Which may be a challenge, as I just lost my private workspace. OK, focus. Focus… gah! 

In other news, I am stepping up my online dating game to try to get some kind of useful material for this story; having rarely experienced attraction (never mutual attraction, lol), and with no experience in dating, I’m forced to rely on second hand ideas, and I’m afraid that may weaken the emotional impact of Cole’s story. 

Although, Cole is kind of distant and weird anyways, so maybe it’ll be ok? Anyways, I’ll be a good, hard working author and do my best to get the research done, lol. Unless it becomes too much of a distraction, in which case I’ll just crib off of every popular teen romance from the last decade.
