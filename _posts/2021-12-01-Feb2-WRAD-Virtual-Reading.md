## World Read Aloud Day Online

**Date:** February 2, 2022

**Time:** 9am - 8pm PST

**Location:** your classroom, library, or book club via Zoom (or similar)

**Type:** Live Reading 

[World Read Aloud Day](https://www.litworld.org/worldreadaloudday) is a "celebration of the power of reading aloud to create community, to amplify new stories, and to advocate for literacy as a foundational human right."

As creators of books for young readers, many members of [CWILL BC](https://cwillbc.org) are offering free 10-20 min. virtual readings in support of this wonderful cause.

While I'm more than happy to present to classrooms, library groups or book clubs of all ages, I write for ages 8+ (published YA + forthcoming MG), so for elementary school groups, I'd be happy to read from an age-appropriate Canadian children's book that inspires me. 

Shoot me a message at [kaiewrites@gmail.com](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) to book a free 10-20 minute reading + author visit on February 3, 2021!
