Ugh, so far behind on everything! On the plus side, I get an extra day of alone time to try to knock some more out. Not nearly enough, but Iâ€™ll take what I can get. Dropping more things every day to try and get more focused and stay on deadline (lol social media), which is not good for my long-range marketing efforts, but possibly maybe helps? Oh yeah, chores and contracts and human interaction also goes poof for at least one more week. The weather is turning miserably sunny and warm though, so itâ€™s not like I actually want to go outside - even the evil cotton fluff is out in force. Nightmarish. Despite all that trimming the fat, so to speak, I did finally get around to dumping a handful of journal entries onto the website in the hopes of ensuring it doesnâ€™t become totally without value. And renewing it - can you believe itâ€™s been a year? And Iâ€™ve only redesigned it, what, a half-dozen times? Not that it isnâ€™t due for another overhaul soonâ€¦

Slow going yesterday, but some great forward momentum at the same time. Wrote in the exchange scene, which really adds a dimension to the story, but also snarls up the flow of the middle/early second act big time. Itâ€™s tough going, trying to piece together continuity and emotional honesty, and even just flow at this point, but at least it feels like itâ€™s going in the right direction. Like every previous stage, the last act is probably gonna get short shrift and be rewritten in, like a day or something because DEADLINES!!! Gah. But needs must. Speaking of needs, I also need to crank out my chapters today and finish off that one horrible outstanding freelance project so itâ€™s not hanging over me. Audiobooks are at a standstill at the moment and Iâ€™m only just over a week out from needing to dive back into the freelancing and make some money, so I probably shouldnâ€™t be ignoring them so much, butâ€¦ yeah. I donâ€™t seem to have much capacity to write and work at the same time. Or at all. But hey, I have a possibly awesome book coming outâ€¦
