I'm passionate about encouraging, inspiring, and equipping readers and writers of all ages and welcome the opportunity to join events including festivals, conferences, school visits, camps and workshops, and more, schedule permitting.

## Experience

I publish short, novelette, novella, and novel-length speculative fiction (fantasy, science fiction & horror) for middle grade (=kids), young adult, and adult readers, and have experience in speaking to elementary, middle school/junior high, high school, and adult audiences.

I'm a registered speaker with (and, as of 2021, president of) the Children's Writers & Illustrators of British Columbia (CWILL BC) Society. (*[Speaker's profile](https://www.cwillbc.org/Member_View.aspx?MemberID=82980)*.)

I'm also a creative writing coach with *[Creative Writing for Children Society](http://www.cwc2004.org/)*, and have extensive experience creating curriculum and facilitating seasonal camps and term-length workshops on creativity, storytelling, and writing themes for ages eight and up.

Previous, one-off, in person and remote festivals, sessions, workshops, panels, and masterclasses have included topics on writing and storytelling including craft, short fiction and/or genre fiction, publishing skills, local-history-in-storytelling, eco-fiction and imagining the future, and motivation and resiliency.

## Logistics

I prefer to work collaboratively with clients to identify the best topics for their needs and audience and don't currently offer "set" presentations. That said, for school settings, I can certainly suggest several topics that have worked well in the past, depending on age and subject. Climate futurism, fighting the patriarchy, ghosts of the past, and horror-meets-humour are popular "broad-interest" topics for general (non-writing) groups, while creative writing or ELA bookings may focus more on paths to publishing, worldbuilding, descriptive writing, etc.

Please enquire regarding dates, fees, and any other pertinent logistics with as much notice as possible.

Fees are generally *[in line with local standards](https://www.cwillbc.org/tips.htm)*, but may be subject to adjustment based on the specific event. Nonprofits should enquire about discounts or alternate arrangements if budget is a barrier. Assistance with grant and funding applications may be available.

Home base is Abbotsford, BC and the nearest international airports for travel purposes are Abbotsford or Vancouver, BC. Zoom/remote presentations are available.

## Testimonials

"Kaie recently joined our Guild of Young Writers program for a virtual Speculative Fiction workshop that exceeded all of our expectations! Kaie provided such an insightful presentation, sharing her own writing process and tidbits about the business of writing itself before diving deep into the elements of speculative fiction.

Her presentation was interactive and engaged the students with specific tips and examples from her own writing, along with suggestions to bring back to their own writing practice. She answered all of their questions with thoughtful and knowledgeable responses and provided the students with such inspiration to move forth with their own writing projects."

-Rebecca Ruiter, Coordinator & Facilitator, [Story Studio Writing Society](storystudio.ca)
