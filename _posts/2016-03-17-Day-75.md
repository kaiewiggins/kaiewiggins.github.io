St. Patrick’s Day! 

Not that that really translates to anything here. Another day of work, chores, wasting time, running errands… but still, maybe I’ll make something with that bottle of Jameson later… 

I did some more (very light!) research on travelling with Rebel, and the locations look amazing (Poland, Krakow, Croatia, and of course Scotland/Ireland), but the money is making me a little bit stressed. It should be doable, but I’m never comfortable when I’ve got more going out than I do coming in, and right now it feels like my entire life is one enormous gamble. But not necessarily in a bad way. 

Just because people love comfort doesn’t mean too much of it’s a good thing for them, right? So I’m going to press on with the risks and try to enjoy the ride!
