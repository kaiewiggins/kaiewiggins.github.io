## It's finally here!!

Three years ago today, I was sitting in so-hip-it-hurts Vancouver standby Brassneck Brewery with a tasting flight, an iPad mini, and a bluetooth keyboard in front of me.

Actually, I totally didn't plan it this way. Facebook very helpfully reminded me this morning with this photo!

Photographic proof that I was typing the first lines of what would eventually become Blind the Eyes on June 1, 2015.

It went on sale today. Three years to the day. I mean, I wish I'd been on it enough to plan it that way, but, um. Total coincidence. ANYWAYS.

Super thanks to my amazing Beta readers who slogged through the many, many drafts over the last three years and to my awesome ARC readers who are already posting reviews!! All-stars, all of you!
