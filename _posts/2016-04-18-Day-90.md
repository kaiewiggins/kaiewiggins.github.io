But at least I’ve made some progress on the primacy factor. Writing comes before the projects, even if it means I may lose opportunities by ignoring them for hours/days at a time… And then, of course, my dad just resigned from his role, which means I’m editing resumes and hashing out negotiation points. It’ll prove a great move for them in the long run, since Abbotsford is a black cesspool of self-absorption and sub-par mental faculties, but makes for a lot of drama in the short term. And of course, eats into my productive hours, once I have two people banging about the house all day long, all week long. I don’t know how writers with kids manage!

. Respect. 

Just finished James Patterson’s final Maximum Ride book(<a target="_blank"  href="http://www.amazon.ca/Maximum-Ride-Forever-James-Patterson-ebook/dp/B00K5UNVJ2/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&keywords=maximum%20ride%20forever&linkCode=ur2&qid=1465874515&s=books&sr=1-1&tag=kaie06-20">Maximum Ride Forever</a><img src="http://ir-ca.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kaie06-20&l=ur2&o=15" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
) - the series that went from engaging YA thriller to preachy environmentalist propaganda and back around again. Which is not to say that I have any real argument with his premises, just that the writing felt pretty stilted and goofy when it got all cause-driven. Especially the Fang’s blog tie-in. Did anyone under the age of 30 actually buy that? But a middle-aged guy writing believable teen-speak is a stretch anyways - to think that he mostly got it right is a marvel. 

Already, I think I’ve passed the point of maximum cultural relevancy (if I ever was relevant…) Case-in-point, just over a year ago I really wanted to correct jr. marketing team boy every time he used the phrase “shit-ton”. Like, really? Turns out, it’s now being used all over the web in journalistic attempts at casual cool, which means… yup. Call me a dinosaur and install me in a museum. I am officially out of date. 

Which is perhaps why I have to write fantasy/sf/supernatural/post-apocalytpic… when you make up your worlds, you can define the trends, craft the slang, and sidestep the unending, regionally-siloed trends in language and youth culture. Maybe.

! Oh, and Joss. Just rewatched <a  href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00HRVUVFO/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=15121&creative=330641&creativeASIN=B00HRVUVFO&linkCode=as2&tag=kaie06-20">Firefly</a><img src="http://ir-ca.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kaie06-20&l=as2&o=15&a=B00HRVUVFO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 with my mom and still can’t believe that Shiny never made it into popular slang usage.  Or rutting. Sounds so much more cultured than f*()#*$. 
 
 Anyways, back to James Patterson and the final Maximum Ride novel. Guess what? Present first-person narrative by the protagonist plus third-person past sections from the perspective of other characters. So I didn’t invent it, but I sure as **** can use it. 
 
 Now I just have to go back and fix all the sections that I ‘fixed’ and wrote in the wrong mode. Talk about patchwork… The writing is taking twice as long as I projected. The rewrites are looking to take that and at least double it again… ugh. Will never finish. 
 
 Some dung-face just wrote one of those helpful listicles about how to enter ‘flow’ zones for writing/coding/artistic vomiting. Eurgh. That only exists for introverted thirteen-year-olds who are bolstered in their determined focus by the hovering of irritating relatives. 
 
 But anyways… Guess I’ll just keep plodding along.
