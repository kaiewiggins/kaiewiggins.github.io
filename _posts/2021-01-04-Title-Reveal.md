Good news: I wrapped up the zero draft of the third and final Threads of Dreams book in early December, which means it's time for a #TitleReveal:

**In the city of nightmares, death is far from the end.**

Who knew a ghost could get up to so much trouble? Cole's never been in a worse bind. But her continued existence, such as it is, is far from the only thing at risk.

If she can't find a way to keep the Mara from being unleashed by the one person she never could have imagined, not only her city, but the whole world will be devoured.

**In this thrilling conclusion to the Threads of Dreams trilogy, the spark of revolution is litâ€”and even a drowned city can burn.**
