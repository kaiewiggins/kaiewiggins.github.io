###Best of Summer
[![A MONSTROUS REGIMENT OF WOMEN by Laurie R. King](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5d9ccc35d544fcc85135fb8ae/images/66faee30-4fb8-4984-a29a-a31876611a91.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104737.A_Monstrous_Regiment_of_Women)
*[A MONSTROUS REGIMENT OF WOMEN by Laurie R. King:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104737.A_Monstrous_Regiment_of_Women)* I can't believe I'm giving top billing to a non-YA, non-fantasy read, but this book honestly takes top prize for my summer reads. All of King's books seem to be excellent quality, and I'm still working my way through the Mary Russell/Sherlock Holmes series, but if you can only read one King book, make it this one. Adult historical fiction/mystery with a feminist twist.
 
###Best Indie
[![THE WAY WE FALL by Megan Crewe](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5d9ccc35d544fcc85135fb8ae/images/ec50d252-5438-4c53-8227-f0e428cc4af4.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8573632-the-way-we-fall)
*[GIVE UP THE GHOST](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6240223-give-up-the-ghost) & [The Way We Fall by Megan Crewe:]*(https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8573632-the-way-we-fall) Canadian Indie author bonus points! Crewe writes disarmingly authentic teens with complex and conflicted motivations, awkward, slow-moving romances and a touch of the creepy. The Way We Fall is first in a trilogy of excellent and very Hollywood-esque plague'pocalypse thrillers. Give Up the Ghost is contemporary-paranormal, and it's <a href="http://www.subscribepage.com/GiveUpTheGhost" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #2BAADF;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">FREE</a> to Crewe's newsletter subscribers.<br>
 
###Best Canadian
[![Missing by Kelley Armstrong:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25487124-missing?ac=1&from_search=true)](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5d9ccc35d544fcc85135fb8ae/images/4c4d3281-344e-4c6f-ae16-587f3c53980e.jpg)
*[Missing by Kelley Armstrong:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25487124-missing?ac=1&from_search=true)* The best thrillers aren't just action-action-action. This tense, surprising read has a lot of heart. The slow-burn romance and challenging, complex characters were incredibly compelling. Armstrong also has a gift for making remote locations sound appealing. Love all her YA books. Add to your list for Halloween spine-tingling horror-lite (no paranormal, just human creepiness!) <br>

###Bonus Round
[![Lockdown by Laurie R. King](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1486052805l/32337121.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32337121-lockdown)
*[Lockdown by Laurie R. King:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32337121-lockdown)* I really don't tend to recommend novels about school shootings . . . or contemporary novels, period, but this is a must-read. The level of craft alone - King writes in a dozen distinct voices, each with character development arcs and backstories - mind-blowing literary skill. But what makes this story readable is that it brings a distinct sense of hope to the otherwise traumatic subject matter.</p>
