So I critically lack discipline and focus. 

Surprise to no one but me, apparently. The thought of diving in to this is a major deterrent for no apparent reason. I drag myself through the miseries of copywriting without nearly the same level of kicking and screaming, and it's getting harder and harder to beat back money making initiatives to keep doing this. 

But. I. Want. To.

So. On it goes.
