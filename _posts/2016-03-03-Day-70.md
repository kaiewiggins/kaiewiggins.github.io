Internet’s down, and I feel frustration and a sense of loss. How dare the mysterious workings of wireless data disrupt my indulgent routine?! 

But I want to get started earlier anyways, so… meh. On it goes. 

Today I wondered if I should have been a marine biologist - I love the aquarium (but not actual nature…), and I got great marks in biology - at least up to the 100 level that I actually took… 

Then I realized I should have taken coding back in high school, but instead I took all the AP Arts classes, because I could use them to skip the first level of university...and only lower class boys took trades courses like computers. 

So yeah, my bad. Pride strikes again. 

But I’m writing again, so maybe something good will come of all the wrong turns in the end, or maybe I started on the right path, and just didn’t have enough determination and focus to stay on it for the last decade… 

It’s weird to remember <a href="http://blackholly.com">Holly Black</a> and her cohort as the next big thing in emerging Teen/YA fiction, and now see them writing kids’ adventure stories for their own children. 

I’ve let myself be left behind. 

But then again, at least it’s not for their grandchildren.
