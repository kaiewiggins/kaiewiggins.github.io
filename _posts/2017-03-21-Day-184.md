Shoved through the first 5 chapters with some significant improvements to the first two yesterday. Thereâ€™s maybe still too much narrative worldbuilding at the front, but at least itâ€™s interspersed with some dialogue-based action now! In some ways, I have such a hard time cutting my own text that Iâ€™d be better of writing fresh, but I cling to the idea that itâ€™s faster to rework existing text (plus I canâ€™t bear to delete any of those precious words, lol).

I figure I need to keep up a pace of at least 5 chapters/day for the remaining three weeks to hit my April 5 deadline - 5 chapters times ~15 days leaves adequate time for the inevitable slowdown near the end where the third act needs to be written freshâ€¦ except that the pattern of baby visits has sliced most weeks down to 4 (or less) working days, and I should probably do another spin through the whole thing at the end to clean up, capture any late changes, and strategize at the scene level. So Iâ€™d be better off completing in excess of 5 chapters a day - 7 or more; 10, ideally. Yeah, not likely, I know. Also pretty much dropping everything else for three weeks, which doesnâ€™t set me up for a good April - international travel, mad consulting/freelance, and learning voiceover narration in three weeks or less? Wish me luck, lol.

Part 2

Just saw more people bashing Carve the Mark on IG and finally felt the need to comment. Now, it may be horribly racist and discriminatory in multiple ways; I havenâ€™t read it, or anything by Veronica Roth, actually, but it was the way things were being approached. People encouraging each other not to read, upset that theyâ€™d bought the book, congratulating each other on scorning itâ€¦ Just, really sad to see, in a forum for book lovers that encourages reading. It was like a far-left variety of book-banning; we donâ€™t like this story, so letâ€™s condemn it and its author. Even if Veronica Roth or her publisher holds the discriminatory views others say theyâ€™ve detected in her work, intelligent discourse and, idk, maybe thinking for ourselves? is desperately needed. The comments Iâ€™m seeing are horrifying not because of the platforms (racism=bad isnâ€™t that controversial, though some of the comments areâ€¦), but because people are vociferously trying to censor others. A fair warning on content is fair; unqualified attacks are not. So now Iâ€™m off to get that book in protest, even though Iâ€™ll probably hate itâ€¦
