Another day of astonishing lack of productivity. It’s turning into an amazing week. Ugh. 

However, I did watch a documentary on addiction that suggested some drug forebears to the nutrition that the Tower uses to control the populace. Vivitrol, gavapentin, anti addiction drugs that subdue cravings. Some are monthly injections, others are pills. 

Totally plausible, right? 

Yesterday’s edits were depressing. I’m not happy with how the first chapter is turning out, or how Cole’s sections read. Also, it took about as long as writing it in the first place. Blearg. 

I’m hesitant to switch to a full third-person past mode throughout, since a lot of Cole’s stuff would be lost, or at least I feel like it would really lose her perspective, but I can’t see telling the whole story from her perspective, nor can I adjust all the other sections to be first person present. 

When I get a chance, I’ll try rewriting that first chapter in third person past and see how it comes out… maybe it’ll be ok?
