## Write A Book In 20 Weeks Workshop(s)

**Date:** weekly from January 28 to June 10, 2023

**Time:** Regular workshops at 9-10AM PST (12-1PM EST), Kids' workshops at 10:30-11:30AM PST (1:30-2:30PM EST)

**Location:** Online over Zoom

**Type:** Writing Workshop

**Need a plan to tackle that "finally write my book" New Year's Resolution?**

Find yourself typing "the end" faster (or maybe for the first time ever!) with a structured, supportive 20-week (term-length) workshop starting January 28 (9 am for adults, 10:30 am for kids) on Zoom.

Each weekly workshop includes live, interactive access over Zoom with short writing exercises and presentations on creative writing, storytelling, plotting & publishing, slide and video archives (for later review and/or if you miss a week), office hours, + individual feedback on up to 20 pages each week.

These workshops are best suited for kids, teens, and adults looking for step-by-step guidance, accountability, and encouragement in starting (and finishing!) the first draft of a (fiction or narrative nonfiction) book.

Class sizes are small due to the amount of individual attention involved, so don't miss your chance to join!
