...I know I've been babbling about it all over the place lately and I've only *just* finished switching over graphics and web presence to the new subgenre, but I'm seriously considering changing everything back to the previous (non) subgenre for BLIND THE EYES of "dystopian dark fantasy". Which isn't an official thing, and I know you're not supposed to genre-blend, but... it just kind of *is*. The setting's pretty dystopian. And it's definitely future and sort of post-apocalyptic. And dark. And there's fantasy and supernatural stuff going on. It's also not a bad fit for urban fantasy, other than the future setting. So I dunno. Waffle waffle waffle. Angst angst angst. lol.

On thing in its favour, the freebie preview ebooks on Amazon got quite a bit stronger downloads when listed as dystopian. So I figure for querying, it should read urban fantasy, and if I end up going indie, dystopian dark fantasy. 

But don't hold me to that, because apparently continuously changing my mind and making work for myself is what I do...
