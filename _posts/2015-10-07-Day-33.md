10 chapters. Over 20K words and 50 hours. 

Still introducing new characters, lol. 

I don’t want to lose momentum by stopping and charting locations and timelines, but this is all getting pretty off course from the plot and even the character outlines. 

Oh well. Save it for the rewrites. 

Apparently I’m not good at strategic writing, things just happen as they happen. 

Also, racy much?! This is definitely turning into a ‘Teen’ or upper YA read. I know that Ravel1 was supposed to be dark and manipulative, and Cole needed to start experiencing emotions and independent thought, but yikes, steamy! Making me blush just writing it; can’t imagine how much I’m going to hate letting the beta readers get ahold of this. 

Also, the names are kinda awkward…? But they make sense in the structure of the world… 

Again, rewrites problems, I guess. Onwards!
