Shoutout to the awesome team at [Word Vancouver](https://wordvancouver.ca/) for the invitation to host their in-person World Read Aloud Day event this year!

I'll be chatting with [CWILL BC](https://www.cwillbc.org/) member and recent debut Emily Seo as she presents a reading from her 2022 middle grade novel *The Science of Boys* and demonstrates some live science.

Local schools will be joining us for this celebration of reading aloud at Surrey Library Central City Branch from 10-11 am on February 1, 2023.

I do also still have availability open on the afternoon of Feb. 1 for schools or libraries who want to book a short, free virtual reading (or, locally, live reading).

In other news, I'm very excited to not-yet-officially be able to announce my first audio adaptation has been licensed! *Hollow* will be coming to a horror podcast near you in the not-so-distant future.

The market has requested the official announcement wait until the story goes live, so all I can really say now is that it's an eerie, Twilight-zone-esque short story inspired by Hollywood North, a Horror Writers of America-qualifying sale, audio-only (first print rights still available), and despite the horror label, suitable for all ages.

And, as a word of encouragement for the writers out there: don't self reject! Getting into this market felt like a real stretch to me, the story is kind of a different direction from my usual (more "straight horror" than cross-genre? But not actually *that* scary? More unsettling/chilling than gory or bloody?), and I'd very nearly retired it from my submissions rotation when the license request came through on a long-dormant sub. You never know what will connect and with whom!

Looking forward to seeing how they interpret this story to audioâ€”so many fun opportunities with the sound design. Will keep you posted when it goes public!
