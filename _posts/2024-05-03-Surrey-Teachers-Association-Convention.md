Presentation description: 
The BC childrenâ€™s publishing community is growing increasingly diverse, relevant, and socially conscious. We're excited to highlight established and emerging voices and titles to help get local stories in the hands of local kids. We'll start with an overview of the power of local storyteller engagement for young readers and highlight free tools and resources offered by CWILL BC. Then a lightning-speed showcase will feature collections of 2023-2024 releases by topic, genre, and age/grade-level with a sprinkling of live mini book-talks and brief recordings highlighting diverse creators and place-based, sustainability, and social justice-oriented titles.

Panellists and presentation pop-up book talk guests, authors/illustrators on site available for signings to be announced. Be sure to get your name in for the book prize draws!
