## It's finally time for the long promised cover reveal!

If you're subscribed to the newsletter, you already got your sneak peek yesterday. For everyone else, surprise! In addition to a brand-new, professionally-designed cover, I've got some other exciting news: Blind the Eyes is competing in Kindle Scout!

#### What does that mean?

- Kindle Scout is the American Idol of publishing
- Readers vote on pre-published books during a 30 day period
- Editors read the manuscripts at the end of voting
- Amazon publishes the best of the combined editor- and fan-approved books in ebook format
- Amazon sends a free ebook to everyone who voted for ("nominated") a book that gets published!

So if you want a chance to get a free copy of BTE, head on over to the Kindle Scout website, [nominate it](https://kindlescout.amazon.com/p/E9IM6GHX3YIJ) and hope it wins!

And hey, why not vote for some other faves while you're at it? You get up to three nominations at a time.

#### What happens if it doesn't get chosen for publishing?

You have to have a complete, finished, fully edited book to compete in Kindle Scout. If BTE isn't chosen for a publishing contract, that just means I'll be able to indie publish it even faster because it's already complete and ready to go out the door!

Look for the release date announcement by mid-April. It'll come out by May 30 or earlier. And for those of you who aren't fans of e-reading, yes, I'll be putting out a bound paperback either way (and an audiobook as soon as possible afterwards). And since I've already hashed out the plot of the next Threads of Dreams trilogy book with my awesome editor [Lisa Poisso](https://www.lisapoisso.com), you can look forward to the sequel coming in 2019!
 
#### What happened to all that querying you were doing?

Wow, it's been over half a year and there are *still* some outstanding queries! There've also been several agents requesting the book, so that's a great sign that it's a good quality read. The thing is, I'm just not ready to spend another year or more (at least!) working on connecting with traditional publishing, and it's not the right choice for every book or every author, either.

I've done a *lot* of research on the writing business and what's best for books, for authors, and for readers. I'm confident that the indie path is right for me and Blind the Eyes. So, sorry for the long-ish wait while I sorted that out!
