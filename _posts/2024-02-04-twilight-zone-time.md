Short, fun announcement that I've been waiting for *ages* to makeâ€”I'm [The NoSleep Podcast](https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/episodes/s20/20x17) official!

Check out my eerie li'l Hollywood North x Twilight Zone x end stage capitalism flash/audio play short based on that *very* short window where I got convinced that being a background performer would be a great writers' life side gig (spoiler: it was not) and ended up as a hilariously clueless but probably overpaid body double for a 12 year old boy.ðŸ« 

Anyway, this is probably my most "straight horror" piece yet (not too much genre blending), more eerie and slow-burn than outright terrifying, with a weird Twilight Zone tilt. Available (only, at this point; licensing enquiries welcome!) as an audio performance by the illustrious NoSleep Podcastâ€”**[give it a listen for free here!](https://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/episodes/s20/20x17)**
