So I finally bit the bullet and bought a new Mac. 

Feeling super conflicted about it. On the one hand, yay shiny new hardware! Gotta love new toys! 

On the other hand, I’m downgrading to half the storage, significantly less RAM by the numbers, and a 17” to 12”… that’s a lot of screen real estate. Plus, you know, money. 

Already, this is proving to be way better for writing on - I’m regretting ordering those solar keyboards and rethinking my plan to upgrade the iPad mini this year - but I’m still really attached to my MacBook Pro. Do I have emotional issues with my technology? Resounding yes! Comes from sleeping with it, I suppose. 

Have to say, these ‘butterfly’ keys are pretty rad, though. Also, losing a lot of time to transferring data and setting up a new machine is a fairly dumb move, but hopefully the timing is at least less painful than it might have otherwise been… Either way, go Apple! Gorgeous tech!
