Yeah, this is really turning into a teen romance fic, I think. Lots of internal monologue (well, after all, I’m writing the protag in first person present, so what do you expect?) Shaping up to be a form of love triangle, not a heck of a lot of action (well, monsters, gruesome death, revolutions, kidnappings, abuse… so maybe a little action!) 

I’m realizing more and more that I may not have any sense of pace or timing. Like, is this slow and boring, or action-packed and engrossing?? 

I’d really like to start getting feedback, but it’s hard to control quality, and I think that would slow down my progress significantly, so I’ll try to keep holding off. 

In other news, halfway to the next milestone (30K words), and there’s starting to be some narrative movement and threads coming together, so that’s great! 

Haven’t looked at my plot outline in over 10K words, so it’s probably a mess, but I think that’ll be a problem for the rewrites stage…
