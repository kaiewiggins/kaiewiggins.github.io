**Update!**

Super random that this just so happens to fall at the end of *another* launch week, but I'm honoured and amazed to learn [*Blind the Eyes*](https://books2read.com/blindtheeyes) has been shortlisted in the eBook Awards 2020 category of the Page Turner Awards alongside some wonderful titles! 

Very excited to (remotely) attend the awards ceremony on October 20â€”though slightly bummed it's a plague year and therefore impossible to pop over to the UK for the party.ðŸ˜¢

Congrats to all the shortlisted eBook and Writing award category entrants ([check out their stories here!](https://pageturnerawards.com/2020-finalists-shortlist-and-winners))
