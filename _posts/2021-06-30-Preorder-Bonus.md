It's just **SEVEN DAYS** to *Burn the Skies* launch day, so I guess I better hurry up and tell you about the preorder bonuses!

**All eBook preorders of *Burn the Skies* (on any storefront) OR library requests are eligible for a FREE digital bonus pack.** ðŸ”¥

It includes a exclusive ebook special edition of *Boy With No Name* (the Ravel antihero side story formerly only available as part of *The Devil You Know* anthology), plus 6+ sheets of printables featuring adorable nature sprites (debuting in *Burn the Skies*, because this book needed a little cute-and-cuddly to balance out all the explosive tension!) for custom DIY magnetic bookmarks, stickers and more. ðŸŽ¨

### To get your bonuses:

1. [Preorder *Burn the Skies*](https://books2read.com/burntheskies) on any storefront OR submit a new book request at your local library before launch day (July 7, 2021).

2. Screenshot or snap a pic of the order confirmation/receipt/library request.

3. [Fill out this Google Form](https://forms.gle/siTt711yqhqb9wT99) and submit your receipt. Your bonuses will be sent to the email you provide by the end of launch week!ðŸ”¥
