This is it! (I think, lol.) Final edits are in, and apparently have a blend of developmental and line edit involved, but either way are intended as the final round before querying/proofreading & publishing unless BtE gets picked up by a trad pub. So of course Iâ€™m looking for ANYTHING else to do this morning, lol. Part of the angsting is traditional (itâ€™s what Iâ€™ve done at every stage), part is confusion, since I had it in my head that the edits werenâ€™t coming in until next week and apparently I havenâ€™t learned to use a calendar again. But itâ€™s great timing â€˜cause I might actually get through everything I need to do this month on the book after all! Ishâ€¦ If I can get queries out before the end of the month, I should still have enough time to wait for responses and pivot to self-pub before the end of the year if I donâ€™t get any offers I like. Not quite full steam ahead, but still, better news than in a long time! And my editorâ€™s email was certainly encouraging too, so hopefully any actual rewrites wonâ€™t be as intense as the last few rounds, lol. â€˜Course that doesnâ€™t stop me being scared to open the reportâ€¦ Gahâ€¦ 

Got a potentially exciting invite to record narration on a YA fantasy overnight too, so more on that later if it goes anywhere. Iâ€™ve also just got papers signed with another emerging audiobook service, so there remains a chance that my world may centre 100% around books going forward - yay! On the other hand, Iâ€™m still toying with a bunch of other plans on the side - starting in about August, the major work on actually creating BtE should be done and itâ€™ll be time to move on. Lots of startup ideas, but I might take a local job instead for a little while and either write the sequel more slowly or save up to finance another writing stretch. The future is coming! Anyways, time to stop procrastinating and actually dive into the edits. Wish me luck, lol.
