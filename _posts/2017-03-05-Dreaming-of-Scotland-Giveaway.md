**How to Enter**

I've created lots of ways to enter so you can join in the fun via your favourite network or stack entries for even more chances to win! You can get 1 entry for each of the following actions up to a total of 4 entries:

- Mailing List: *Join my [mailing list](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/kaiespace)* for publishing updates, previews and other bonus content. Subscribing will take you to the *Revue* website, which is what I use for newsletters. Mailing list subscribers are automatically entered in all current and future giveaways. (& I promise not to spam you!) 
- Instagram: *Follow* [@kaie.space_author](https://www.instagram.com/kaie.space_author/), *repost* the original image of the giveaway you want to enter (either or both!) on your feed and *tag* me in it, leave up for at least 24 hours (and until I comment/like it so you know I got your entry!)
- Facebook: *Like & Follow* [K A Wiggins](https://www.facebook.com/K-A-Wiggins-424659727877061/) and *comment* on the original giveaway post that you want to win (either or both)
- Goodreads: *Add [@kaiespace](https://www.goodreads.com/kaiespace) as a friend* on Goodreads and *comment* which giveaway you most want to win (more than one is ok!) 

Both giveaways are open to residents of the USA, United Kingdom & Canada.

I will contact winners via the platform they entered for their mailing address. Winners will have 72 hours to respond or a replacement winner will be drawn. 

**Small Print (lol):**

This is probably unneccessary, but anyways... Giveaway or commercial accounts are not included in the giveaway. Social Media accounts must be following/friends at the time of giveaway closing. I reserve the right to close any and all giveaways at my discretion. Giveaways are offered by K.A. Wiggins and have no affiliation with Instagram, Facebook, Revue, Github, prize manufacturers, or any other corporation, entity or company. K.A. Wiggins is not responsible for any outcomes related to this giveaway up to and including mail delivery failures and damage to or by giveaway items.
