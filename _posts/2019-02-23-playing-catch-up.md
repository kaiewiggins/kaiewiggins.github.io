Bear with me, guys. There's been a ton going on this year (how is it almost March?!?) but between releasing new stories, writing newsletters, book marketing, sublicensing, translations(!), international speaking invitations, and even a dash of actual writing in all that, I've fallen behind on updating this site.

So . . . keep an eye out for all those things, I guess? And I'll try to copy important news over here as soon as I get a chance.
