Still avoiding lots of things that I probably shouldnâ€™t be (lol?) - although Iâ€™ve come up with a better excuse for not making plans; my parents my be interviewing for jobs in the States and it would be better for me to be around to cat-sit. Also, Iâ€™m definitely not booking anything until the end of next month/editorial deadline b/c letâ€™s face it, Iâ€™m gonna need the time to work on this draft anyways. Although I keep saying it takes just as long to recut/edit existing text as write new, Iâ€™m now at the point where I have to put that to the test, and if it doesnâ€™t take any longer (which may not actually be accurate), it does take more out of me. I think Iâ€™m one of those writers that hates to write/loves to have written/needs to write, lol. Like, it does feel good when Iâ€™m in the zone (which doesnâ€™t last long at all), and after, and when I think about doing it but really have no intention of actually doing it, but the worst part is sitting down and getting to it. And also starting doing it. And continuing while doing it. And having to stop and go to the bathroom when Iâ€™m in the middle of it. Writing, man. Such love-hateness. And Iâ€™m sore from, like, sitting all day trying to convince myself to write, but I donâ€™t want to give up writing time to get out and, like, move. Like, whatever. (lol, I donâ€™t know why that had to be said Valley-girl style, but it did.) I had coffee this morning. I think itâ€™s doing something to my brain. Specifically the language-processing and coordination bits. And now, I think, I need to stop and IG instead of write, which is dumb but anywaysâ€¦
