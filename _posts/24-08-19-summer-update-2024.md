Whole pile of news to get through, so let's dive right in with the new (short) fiction arrivals:

- JULY: Canadian ghost town/ecopunk horror [**"The Tangle (Did Not Kill Kitsault)" in STRANGE HORIZONS**](http://strangehorizons.com/fiction/the-tangle-did-not-kill-kitsault/) July 1 edition & SF fungal humour [**"The Pink Slime's Appointment With Destiny" in PULPHOUSE FICTION MAGAZINE Issue 31**](https://pulphousemagazine.com/products/pulphouse-fiction-magazine-issue-31)

- AUGUST: Slipstream/Neurodivergent flash [**"Mud Maidens Rise" in LIGHTSPEED MAGAZINE Issue 171**](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/mud-maidens-rise/) (incl. "audiobook" version!) and a reprint of Canadian eco-anxiety body horror rom-com [**"Children of Earth" in PULPHOUSE FICTION MAGAZINE Issue 32**](https://pulphousemagazine.com/collections/the-magazine)

- Another Commonwealth Short Story Prize longlister—Vancouver opioid poisoning crisis ghost story [**"The Patron Saint of Flatliners", now available at MYSTERION**](https://www.mysteriononline.com/2024/03/the-patron-saint-of-flatliners.html)—plus yet another reprint in the pipeline. Look for some very cool Halloween horror antho crowdfunding news soon to get in on cool special edition stuff!

Books still behind schedule and I'm still drastically overcommitted schedule-wise but working on it. Latest development: adding songwriting to the mix, because when you're underwater, why not swim down instead of up??? Hoping/planning to prioritize SONGSTRESS WIP for the remaining weeks of summer before fall crashes down upon me and swallows all my writing time.

Teaching & events continue to be a busy and growing part of the puzzle:

- The spring creative writing term (novel-writing intensive, elementary/junior) was fantastic as you can see from the creative covers the kids put together for their wonderful books below! This fall, I'll be doing an "art of the short story" intensive and anthology making workshop for teens on Thursday and Friday afternoons (remote extracurricular—contact [Creative Writing for Children Society](https://cwc2004.org/) for more information/to register.) I don't have time as of September, but if there's interest from adults or institutions, get in touch via the contact form and let me know—I might be able to get something in the calendar in later fall or next spring . . .

- Had an awesome high school mega author visit in the Tricities area! Chatted with a brilliant creative writing club and talked up short fiction and writing as a career and did a (hilarious! angsty! surprisingly insightful!) interactive "whiteboard" storytelling/improv creative writing exercise with the gen-pop Grade 9-12 English classes

- Got to do a (remote) book club visit/writing consult for adult readers (not institutional/"just" fans) as well, which was super fun and something I keep meaning to set up a booking form for, but alas, it remains on my very long to-do list. Reach out about pricing and schedule if this is something you want!

- Excellent (but exhausting!) spring conference season at the BC Library Association Conference and Surrey Teachers' Association Convention, and I *still* need to follow up with some connections from those events. What a whirlwind! Intentionally tried to leave a little room this fall to allow for any new opportunities that might crop up, but already I am looking forward to speaking at both the BC (public) Librarians' youth services and school library conferences this fall. ALL the library love, all the time~ (Also on the horizon, some hush-hush arts council workshop fun in the tri-cities area. Schools, institutions, arts councils, etc., feel free to reach out!)
