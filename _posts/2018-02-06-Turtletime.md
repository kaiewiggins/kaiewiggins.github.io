Official announcements plus some updates for the new year! Where things are at: 

- I just pulled all the preview editions from ebookstores. The three chapter special preview edition of Blind the Eyes has done really well on Amazon and the other usual suspects, but it's also been up for half a year longer than I expected, since I pivoted from indie publishing to querying. It's a little hard to continuously build momentum while also pushing the release date further and further into the future, so for the moment I'm pressing pause on all book marketing initiatives. However, I'll still be present and active on social media, and the onsite and newsletter-exclusive extended downloadables will remain available!

- & on that note, yes, Blind the Eyes is *still* under query until at least March 2018. There's been some good feedback and several agents have asked for additional materials to review. I'll review opportunities in March and update you all accordingly! I've been eyeing the Kindle Scout program, so if I do go indie, that'll be my first stop (after the cover reveal! You guys, it's SO GOOD and I've been waiting over half a year to show you!) 

- but the other reason I'm turtling into my introvert shell for the rest of winter, besides, y'know, just straight up waiting for tradpublishing to get a move on, is because I just finished developmental consultation on book 2 with my awesome editor last week! Friends, it's gonna be good! Blind the Eyes is just the tip of the iceburg, and things get crazy FAST in book 2 . . . at least, that's the plan. I start writing this month.

- Speaking of book 2, it doesn't have a name yet because I finally clued in that you can't just "borrow" song lyrics for titles. Oops! Which means the trilogy needs a new name. I was thinking "Threads of Dreams" would be a good one. What d'you all think?

- Other stories are *still* on hiatus too, but hey, I managed to word-vomit *one* short story. No you can't read it (yet). I took a shot at writing a topical contemporary piece, and instead it turned into a weird, profane, and decidedly paranormal take on the Fentanyl crisis in Vancouver. So . . . yeah, I'm thinking I should take some time cleaning that up before sharing. But yay accomplishments - anytime I finish something with a beginning, middle, and end, it's a good thing!

- Freelance writing and consulting work is picking up for the new year, which is another reason to pull back. Find me at [Business Writing Solutions](http://www.businesswriting.solutions) for website, technical, and copywriting, among other stuff.

- *Still* in the Pacific Northwest - I totally had a trip back to the UK planned, and then realized I'd double booked over my nephew's first birthday! But hey, I'm more likely to get that book in your hands sooner if I'm not digital-nomadding my way around the world anyways, right?

- Thanks for sticking around for this (looong) journey! If you haven't already, sign up for the newsletter for freebies, previews, and news when books are available, or follow me on social media, Goodreads, or BookLikes for reviews of recent and upcoming YA fantasy. Links on your left.
