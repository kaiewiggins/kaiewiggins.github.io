News to no one, but yeah, definitely falling behind due to my Twitter addiction and obsession with everything #pitchwars right now. Which, I mean, priorities I guess? â€˜Cause technically BtE is in pretty good shape and the best thing I can do right now is widen my community/audience/reach and get all the query and pitch material shined up, but itâ€™s eating at me that I might not get the rewrites I want to done in time. I mean, not enough to actually motivate me to prioritize them, butâ€¦ lol.

I agreed to cat sit for someone next week, before all this, and now Iâ€™m deeply regretting it, as they only wanted daytime but theyâ€™re an hours walk away or !40m by bus because local transit sucks and Iâ€™d spend 1/3 of what Iâ€™ll bring in on it just on the bus rides each day b/c itâ€™s not overnight and why did I agree to this? So I have to go over there tonight and do the whole meet n greet orientation thing and Iâ€™m just annoyed that itâ€™s taking away from writing/revising/Twitter time (but really: I said yes b/c itâ€™d force me to actually go outside on a regular basisâ€¦ plus spare change.)

Drowning under the flood of resources Pitchwars is stirring up, including a SUPER depressing one on how you should really only expect to get offered around $10-$20 for your book and even if youâ€™re super lucky and get 6 figures for a two book deal it breaks down to about $20k/year. Which, I mean, I did know and itâ€™s part of why I was moving towards the whole indie publishing thing, but still, the details had thankfully faded in my mind and I was having fantasies of my future actually working out, lol. It really is a super crowded field; my TBR pile is as long as all the books Iâ€™ve marked done on Goodreads and only getting longer (1k+) with amazing sounding stories, so I can see how itâ€™s a stretch for everyone to get paid, but itâ€™s pretty insane when compared to the amount of work put in. Justine Larbaleister had a thread about how working writers should get businesslike with it and stop bleeding onto the page, but I canâ€™t imagine cranking out material so cynically (not to mention productively.)

Anyways, got the first draft hooks and comp titles off to my editor yesterday, and she hasnâ€™t chucked â€˜em back, so Iâ€™m gonna take advantage of the couple hours I can grab to dive back in on rewrites!
