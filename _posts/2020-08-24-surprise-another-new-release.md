There's been an unexpected end-of-summer wave of excellent news, most of which I can't share (yet) BUT I am very excited to announce a story in Fiction-Atlas Press's next anthology. *Boy With No Name* is a Threads of Dreams tie-in featuring everyone's favourite troublemaker Ravel. It's a companion story to *Black the Tides* and—random coincidence—the anthology is set to release on BTT's *original* launch date, September 30!

### The Devil You Know: A Fiction-Atlas Press Anti-Hero Anthology

**These heroes might not be angels, but you know what they say—it's always better to trust the devil you know...**

Looking for a typical hero tale? Keep looking. These twelve tales explore the grittier side of what it means to make life's hardest choices, and let your reputation pay the price. From back-alleys and ancient cities to graveyards and castle walls, these trouble-makers are out for themselves...or are they?

Fiction-Atlas Press is proud to present, The Devil You Know featuring stories by: USA Today Bestselling Author C.L. Cannon, USA Today Bestselling Author Lily Luchesi, Zoey Xolton, K.A. Wiggins, K Matt, K.R.S. McEntire, Scott Moore, J.M. Rhineheart, Angela Kulig, Kat Parrish, Amber Morant, and Nick Edinger!

## Boy With No Name

**When you’re nothing, you have to grab everything you can and hang onto it with everything you’ve got.**

Ravel clawed his way up from failed test subject to master of the decadent underground club Freedom—not to mention shadow prince of the Towers of Refuge—and his ambition is far from sated.

He knows everyone’s secrets, holds all the keys, and his hand is in every deal worth making. Even the recent, catastrophic invasion of the nightmarish Mara hasn't shaken his confidence.

When human sacrifice is the price of power, a small massacre is nothing more than a setback.

But when the dreamwalker Ravel's been obsessed with since childhood vanishes from his monster-infested city, he risks everything he's built and become to chase her down.

Cut off from everything he knows, can this master manipulator find the right thread to pull and win back his love?

Or will the conscience he's been running from all his life finally take him down?

*Tragic pasts and twisted futures collide in Boy With No Name, a standalone-ready companion story to Threads of Dreams book 2, Black the Tides, available exclusively in Fiction-Atlas Press anti-hero anthology The Devil You Know coming September 30*
