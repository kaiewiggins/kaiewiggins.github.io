I've been chatting with and presenting to educators and librarians across BC (& beyond) for several years now, as well as teaching kids and teens in extracurricular programs and in classrooms as a TOC.

Reading and writing levels are, to say the least, not where most teachers would like them to be. It's often a struggle to get through book (novel) studies in class. Time and resources are thin on the ground in many districts and holding students' attention is a constant battle.

Over the same period, I've gotten more and more involved in the speculative (Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror) short fiction scene, and I had the idea that bringing the two together might present at least a partial solution to some of the challenges teachers are facing.

Current short SFF/H is fantastic—timely, sharp, diverse, written by, about, and to a range of identities and backgrounds, written to a high standard with plenty of fodder for literary as well as social discussion and writing inspiration.

While there can be a place for teaching the classics (especially in conversation with reimaginings) and there's certainly value in reading and teaching novels, I'd like to encourage educators to incorporate short fiction over passages/extracts wherever possible (so as to preserve narrative arc.)

And, given my context of practice and current world events, I've focused most of my efforts on the Canadian school system and voices. I'm also leaning into Speculative (SFF/H) because it's my community/most of what I'm familiar with and I think it holds more appeal to teens (give them fiction they'll feel like they're "getting away with" reading not that they "have to read"), but there is certainly high quality general/non-genre short fiction coming out of Canada these days as well!

I recently field tested this idea in a workshop titled "Teaching Current Canadian Short Fiction to Today’s (& Tomorrow’s) Teens" at the Surrey Teachers' Association Convention (please reach out if your organization would like a similar talk!)
 
**Here's a quick-ref list of all the resources referenced during the workshop:**

- Recommended [Short Speculative CanLit for Teens](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ltkuyctM3QIp_bPVwVRjz32j7ZhIBisdLR8cSGPW0bs/edit?usp=sharing) Chart: see "readme" tab for selection criteria & search tips. I've added some discussion questions, suggested extension activities and links to some creative writing prompt worksheets in the "Resources" column since the workshop.

- [Canadian Science Fiction & Fantasy Association](https://www.csffa.ca/aurora-archives-home/): Home of the annual Aurora Awards program that collects eligible, shortlisted, and winning Canadian SFF in a variety of categories (short fiction, YA & adult novels, comics, etc.) This is the most prestigious genre-specific writing award in Canada and one way to stay current (will collect stories from the past year only.) NOTE: If you ever have hyper-engaged SFF-fan students, they actually can join the CSFFA for $10 to get a free reading/voting packet of the shortlisted works in that year (about 5 books/stories/comics etc./category) and vote on their favourites; membership is not just for professionals.)

- [Year's Best Canadian Fantasy & Science Fiction](http://kotowych.com/bookstore/) Anthology Series: Annual Ansible Press anthology of the previous year's best Canadian SFF edited (selected) by Stephen Kotowych. This is another way to keep up with current fiction that has a ~approx. 1 year delay, as it's a reprint anthology. E.g., Vol. 3 will publish in November 2025 and have stories originally printed in 2024. NOTE: you could go with class sets if there are multiple stories in any given edition that you're excited to teach, but if just one or two stories stand out to you, try checking the original publication venue. Sometimes they're free to read online (this is common in many SFF magazines these days...) I'll always link all known venues/sources for stories on the recommendation chart to make it easy to check.

- [Black Cat Books](https://www.blackcatbooks.net/) Anthologies: Annual dark SFF/H anthologies by 100% Canadian authors from a Victoria-based small press. Short fiction set in the Pacific Northwest/BC (mostly Vancouver Island/Coastal BC) by authors from BC, Yukon & the Prairie Provinces, with a strong bent toward local history, social justice, and local interest stories. Target audience is teens through early 20s (includes profanities & violence). Some comics included in past short fiction anthologies, and their website claims a graphic novel anthology is underway.

- [Augur Society](https://augursociety.org/): Canadian publishers of two 95% Canadian SFF/H publications, Augur Magazine (darker/higher stakes) & Tails & Feathers (cozy/low-stakes).

Please feel free to pass along any and all of these resources to colleagues who many be interested in the topic!
