These slides are from a series of workshops for young writers and present a rough and very broad overview of things to think about and possible next steps for emerging authors. Disclaimers: your mileage may vary, never accept 100% of what you're told, do your own research, etc. The important thing here is to think critically and choose the right path for YOU and your work.

### Identify Your Goals

This might seem obvious (and it applies to all of publishing, not just short fiction), but it's actually very important to really dig into what matters to *you*.

Are you building a long-term career? Do you dream of publishing full time? Do you care more about money or creative freedom or acclaim? Is it really more about getting your stories or ideas out to the world? Do you crave feedback? Is writing really a private pursuit that brings joy to you but that you don't want the eyes (and opinions) of the world on? Is publishing a path to something else—recognition, acclaim, support for a different eductational or career trajectory?

Your answers may surprise you and/or change over time—which is fine! We all do the best we can and move forward as best we can, making mistakes along the way. But if you can clarify your goals (and dreams and hopes and . . . ) it'll help you think critically about the information available and choose the most promising path for your needs.

### Ways To Connect With Readers

This is vital: if you want to get your work out into the world, that means working with others.

Young writers and newcomers may be used to a more critical perspective on "literature" (damage from high school/college lit classes, no doubt), or channel their insecurities into aggression, or simply lack the experience to recognize just what (and to what extent) they don't yet know. 

**Time for a change of focus: other writers are now your peers.** Not long-dead entities to be picked apart in analysis and critique. Not competitors (even when they are). Not faceless corporations. Real people who you may bump into from time to time, friends, colleagues, possibly even someone who will one day be in a position to help or hurt your career. Proceed accordingly.

Try to adjust your perspective on other emerging writers and readers as well; they're now potential friends, colleagues, and fans. Be kind. Be helpful. Be professional. Don't be scared.

You'll need people who are on your side (or at least willing to lend a hand temporarily) at nearly every step of your writing journey. People who'll share tips, give feedback (if you ask for it), buy books, write reviews, shout about your books to other readers.

If you intend to publish a book or otherwise care about getting your words out to readers, it's never too early to start. Nothing published to share yet? Build platforms (website/social media, etc.) around shouting about books you like, ideally ones that are similar to what you hope to write. By the time you're ready to search for readers, you'll have contacts who you can share the news with!

And consider starting with something smaller and less resource intensive than a book, especially if you're a student. Short stories, fanfiction, and serial fiction are a few ways to get your words in front of readers with less pressure. Bite-sized content is a growing market *and* it's more doable for you, especially if you're balancing creating with a busy school or work schedule.

See other posts in the [Resources](/resources.html) section for links to short fiction and serial fiction markets.

At time of writing, [Wattpad](http://wattpad.com/) and [Archive Of Our Own (AO3)](https://archiveofourown.org/) are the biggest fanfiction platforms. Use filters to keep content kid-friendly if you're underage or simply uninterested in the thriving adult content sections. ;)

Quick aside: ALWAYS read the contracts before sharing your work and make sure your rights are protected. More on that in a bit.

### Establishing Your Reputation/Skill

This section was originally intended for students, but writers of all ages can get into sharing their words for reputational purposes.

Students may find it helpful in scholarship, college, or job applications. Adults may simply want the prestige, or use it as a (small) building block to a writing career or a complement to a different field.

Awards and accolades don't sell lots of books. They can be useful in building a "brand" as a writer, however, and may lead to more opportunities or visibility over time.

Larger scale or higher profile awards or story markets can be more beneficial, but the competition will be higher. That's not to say don't enter—always take your shot! But local/regional and student-specific competitions/markets will be relatively easier to make a splash in. Also note that certain topics or styles will play better with some judging panels or editors/magazines than others. The closer you match their preferences, the more likely you are to get a 'yes' and that has nothing to do with skill or quality. (Don't get discouraged!)

While publishing as a teen may sound promising, it tends to be less of a selling point than you might think. Unless you're entering a student competition or otherwise required to disclose such details, avoid mentioning your age/grade.

See other posts in the [Resources](/resources.html) section for links to competition and short fiction markets. ALWAYS read contracts and follow posted guidelines.

### Earning an Income With Short Fiction

Writing is not known for it's incredible financial rewards—usually. That doesn't mean it won't or can't pay, but the effort tends not to pay off quickly or reliably. Don't overreach. The next section dives into rates, but in terms of markets, you can place short stories in competitions, print and/or genre or literary magazines or 'zines, other types of magazines that sometimes include a small fiction segment, anthologies, or individually be self-publishing.

Reading submission guidelines and writing a custom piece in response sometimes results in better (=closer) fits, but you can also just write freely and then look for the right market after the fact. Note that preparing, submitting, and tracking story submissions takes time in its own right, putting further pressure on any income you might recieve.

Nonfiction (particularly business) writing tends to be paid at higher rates, but you normally pitch the idea of a feature or article to an editor *before* writing, whereas with fiction, you write the whole piece and submit it.

See other posts in the [Resources](/resources.html) section for links to competition and short fiction markets. ALWAYS read contracts and follow posted guidelines.

### Short Fiction Rates

Graphic from [writingsmarter.com](http://writingsmarter.com).

Always ALWAYS read the submission guidelines. There is variation between accepted story lengths and rates of pay. But this works fairly well as a general guideline. Note that professional writers tend to speak in terms of wordcount because page count varies depending on formatting and is an unreliable indicator. We really only use it to speak to readers who are used to thinking in those terms.

Many short fiction "markets" do not pay. Some are prestigious; many are new and/or hobby projects for the founder. That doesn't mean they're automatically bad! They make be a good stepping stone or practice for beginners, or provide an outlet for those who love sharing their words but aren't bothered about the income side of things. As usual, always read the terms/contracts/guidelines to make sure you're not signing away more rights than you mean to.

We'll look at rights/licensing in a bit, but it's good to keep in mind that the first sale is usually the most valuable and accessible to make, and consider holding out for a "higher" level market. Reprints aren't as widely accepted in paying markets, and it's harder work to place them. In general, I recommend shooting high and then working your way down a wishlist of possible story markets until a story lands.

Magazines and other short fiction markets rarely pay on royalties, but the exception is anthologies. Sometimes they're paid in a lump sum upon signing, but "royalty-split" arrangements aren't uncommon. While your income is therefore unreliable, this can be a good option if you've built a platform of readers eager to pay for your work and/or the other authors in the anthology have a strong platform to market to as well.

Token rates are generally in the $5-$40 range, where the market can't afford more but feels it's important to pay *something.* The Science Fiction Fantasy Writers of America ([sfwa.org](http://www.sfwa.org/about/join-us/sfwa-membership-requirements/?fbclid=IwAR1kwEOLL465fHfjtkEGuY0igU81ucK1a1krW5UPOYFpSrCpBkPb6nL4Pzg#short)) has set pro rates at $0.08/word, but you'll see anything from half a cent on up. Some markets also offer lump sum payments in the 100+ range. Generally, the more they pay, the more the competition, but don't self-reject—the worst they can do is say no!

### Gut Check Break!

I'll keep repeating this, but ALWAYS read the submission guidelines and follow them. Your story should be creative; your formatting and document presentation should not be. If no specifics are given, follow [Shunn Manuscript Format, modern edition](https://www.shunn.net/format/story/) as the default.

Some competitions charge entrance fees. Some writing markets charge reading fees, but far from all. You can spend a lot of money *trying* to get published, but you don't have to. Avoid fee-charging markets or competitions unless you think your story has an excellent chance of earning the expense back or unless money is no object.

It's easy to get caught up in the pursuit. After a few submissions, you just really *really* want an acceptance. Try to clarify your goals and keep them front and center. Write them down and post them in your workspace if that helps.

On a related note, always read the contract. Some market post a sample one. Most competitions will also post terms. Some "opportunities" aren't. See other posts in the [Resources](/resources.html) section for links to reading, understanding and negotiating contracts.

Consider the reader(s) before submitting. What kind of reader is likely to appreciate your story (if it's already written). What might the judges or first readers/editor care about and appreciate? You can research past award-winners or other stories in a magazine to get an idea, but if you're submitting a lot, it's not practical to do too much research.

Finally, make yourself a tracking document or spreadsheet early on. Keep track of submissions, contract terms for licensed stories, and details of the stories themselves. This seems silly at first, but if you keep writing and submitting, you'll quickly get beyond the point where you can keep track in your head. See other posts in the [Resources](/resources.html) section for links to competition and short fiction markets, including online tracking sites.

### Licensing & YOU

Experienced and prolific author/editor/publisher Dean Wesley Smith talks about the idea of a "magic bakery' when it comes to writing. You can read about it [in his own words](https://www.deanwesleysmith.com/the-magic-bakery-chapter-one/) and [in this excellent blog](https://kriswrites.com/business-musings ) by his wife, Kristine Kathryn Rusch. But, in a nutshell, the concept is that intellectual property—like our writing—can be sold over and over, in part and in whole, unlike other goods.

Your work automatically belongs to you from the time of its creation. You own full copyright. (The exception is when you're writing as work-for-hire, or working on an IP project that belongs to someone else, like a Star Wars tie-in novel, for example.) Technically, you *could* transfer copyright in a sale (if you sign a terrible contract), but don't.

Instead, you license the right to use the work in part or in whole. Some examples: Licensing first publication rights in English, then, when the exclusivity period expires, licensing reprint rights (over and over again) or publishing it yourself as a standalone or in a collection. You can also license (and re-license) translation rights, audio rights, production rights (for film/tv), merchandising rights, etc. All that off of one story (potentially).

The moral of the story? Keep your copyright, don't license more rights than the licensee will use (to your benefit), and make sure your contracts aren't perpetual (so you can get licensed rights back eventually and re-license them.)

### Publishing Novels

Switching gears here from short fiction to long. This is a bigger effort in terms of time, skill, and investment, but novels are not inherently better than any other type of fiction. Try not to feel pressured into writing one if you don't really want to!

Whatever publishing path you choose, you will become a small business. Like any entrepreneur, you'll need to learn business skills and keep up on your industry, even if it's just a side hustle. Do your research as you approach publishing; things change in a matter of months in this industry, much less years, and you don't want to be launching with outdated intel. See other posts in the [Resources](/resources.html) section for links to groups and news outlets for staying up to date.

Publishing can pay, but it's usually a slow and gradual path to earning an income. Royalties can accumulate over time. The opportunity to sell additional licenses may emerge. The more stories/books you have out, the more it all can add up, but that takes time, too. Make a plan for how you'll survive financially for the first years at least.

Be open to nontraditional routes: serial fiction and subsidized or serialed fiction are looking strong right now. Patreon and Kickstarter are good examples of emerging trends that authors have leveraged to the advantage of their careers.

### One Route

Not much to add here. This is roughly what I do these days. It's pretty minimal compared to some, unneccessarily complex compared to others. I can't quite bring myself to draft-proofread-publish, but I'm not doing multiple rounds of heavy rewrites, either. If I get really stuck on the plotting, I'll change formats, which can look like any of these:

### Story Mapping
  
While all the charts and cards can look complex, the basic structure I'm using is a three act structure with four quarters.

The first quarter and the first act map together and contain the inciting event early on (at about the 10% mark). Something disrupts the main character's ordinary life and sends them in a new direction. It ends around the 25% mark with the change of plans turning point. This is where the main character chooses (or gets dragged into) the adventure/quest/journey of the story.

The second act is easiest to understand if you split it evenly in two. The first half is the character struggling to make forward progress and understand their situation/world/challenge/self etc. Around the 50% mark or midpoint turning point (end of the second quarter) they make a discovery or realization that shifts their trajectory. 

Now, starting the third quarter, the main character(s) (thinks they) know what they need to do to succeed, though they still face obstacles. The second act/third quarter ends with the black moment turning point, the darkest point of the story, either figuratively or literally involving death. The main character may feel as though they've failed, there's no hope, maybe no point going on. They may be focused on revenge or retribution.

But, into the final quarter/act, they'll need to rally enough to take on the greatest challenge of the story in the final turning point, the climax. Often this follows a mini arc of setting out, making progress, making a sudden realization that changes their perspective or goal, hitting a "black moment" of despair, and then rallying to overcome (in a positive story arc, at least). There's often an inner and outer component to this, the main character finding inner strength or understanding in order to overcome the outer challenge of the story. The last 10% or so of the final act wraps up the story by showing the new normal—and/or setting up a sequel.

Little Red Riding Hood isn't the best example because it's missing main character agency in most variations. Ideally, you want your main character's actions and choices to be integral to every turning point.

If you hate how structured this all is, welcome to the club. I fought this idea *hard*—but it really does result in faster drafting and stories readers seem to enjoy more. And there's tons of room for creativity within this loose structure. Also, those percentages will come in handy in a moment.

### Math For Authors

Everyone's favourite, right? But hang in there, this comes in really handy.

You can apply the turning point percentages we just looked at to a target wordcount (above) to plan how to draft your novel. Pick a target wordcount, jot down some notes about each turning point (or go in blind, if that's your preference), and track your wordcount as you write.

For instance, if you're planning an industry-standard middle grade novel (40,000 words, say), as you're coming up to 15,000 words you know you've got the midpoint coming up and you need to get your character in place within the next 5,000 words or 4-5 hours of writing.

If your target is 80k words for a YA fantasy, you're going to be preparing to write that midpoint as you near 40k words (or try to include an inciting event within the first 8k words, or a black moment around the 60k mark, etc.) These intervals help make stories feel like they're moving along at a natural clip to western readers who are mostly used to this story pattern. If you're far off these proportions, it can manifest as portions of the story feeling slow-paced or rushed.

But, as with all writing advice, you can take it or leave it. Other story structures exist. Some writers have stronger instinctual structure, while others find it easier to write to a plan. There's no one right way, but if you're not sure where to start, I suggest trying this structure.

### Paths to Publication

Determined to get a book-shaped story out into the world? Here's a rough outline of what it might look like.

As we'll look at, traditional publishing is often slower with lots of waiting between steps, and possibly more drafts and rewrites. Agents are *not* essential but we all act like they are, and it's unlikely that you can get a manuscript in front of a major publisher without one.

If you choose to independently pubish (self-publish), you don't have to do every one of these steps, but you do need to either learn to do or learn enough to hire someone to do most of them. And in both cases, your job does not end when that book hits store shelves.

---

<img src="/19-trad2.png" width="95%;">

### Big 4 Publishing

Most of this boils down to: it's slow, there are no guarantees, and you've got to look out for yourself. The traditional publishing landscape has been getting worse for authors over the years, but do your research and make the best choice for you and your book. Things may change.

---

<img src="/20-trad3.png" width="95%;">

### Publishing Tips

Agents (and publishers) have been known to steal from authors. That said, there are some very well intentioned people out there. As always, do your research and be intentional in your choices. Small and micro presses often offer better contract terms. They may still steal from you or go out of business. Proceed with caution, and watch out for "hybrid" publishers.

In traditional publishing, all money (should) flow to the author. If you're paying for anything, something's wrong. Don't pay "reading fees" to agents or publishers, that's a scam. If you have to pay to get the book out there, that's independent publishing with a services company ("hybrid publisher"), not a real publisher. If that's something you want, just be careful with the contracts and don't sign away licenses without getting compensated.

---

<img src="/21-trad4.png" width="95%;">

### Benefits of Traditional Publishing

Despite the evidence, it's not all downsides!

Book advances have gone down, but you at least get something, rather then spending your money to get published. There is still some prestige to "being published," particularly by a major publisher. It can open doors. You'll be eligible for more awards and speaking opportunities (whether you have a chance or want them is a separate question.)

If you write for children (babies through to teens, in the publishing world), traditional publishers may be able to get your book out more widely—to public libraries and schools, for instance.
