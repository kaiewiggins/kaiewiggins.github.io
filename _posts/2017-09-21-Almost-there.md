I should get the next newsletter out in a couple weeks, but since I'm past due for an update, thought I'd pop in and share the progress! 

BLIND THE EYES is out for query with a number of literary agents. For the uninitiated, to get a book published in the traditional manner, you send a sort of formal application letter to literary agents, who ask for more information on your book (or decline). If they love the story and think they can sell it to a publisher, they offer to represent you. Then they contact editors and try to sell the manuscript. Then a publishing house responds with an offer (and if you're really lucky, you get a few of these to choose from). Then you get assigned an editor and work with that publisher and editor to adapt the book, which can mean more editing, rewrites, proofreading, cover designs etc. Then the book comes out in stores, 1-3 years later. And at every step of the process, it's super competitive and subject to both market demand and the relevant professionals falling in love with your work.

I've had some really encouraging responses from agents, but nothing to tempt me away from indie publishing so far. That said, the publishing world moves super slowly, so I've only heard back from a quarter of the queries I've sent out so far. 

So here's the plan: there's only a couple steps left to produce BLIND THE EYES as an independent publisher. It still needs a final proofread, final back cover copy and interior layout/design. I'm getting in touch with a proofreader this week to line that up for late October - it's a minor cost and worth risking to set up. My cover artist can do interior design, but I still need to talk to her about a schedule. If she's available, I think everything could be done for as early as the middle of November. So... no promises guys, but I'm thinking a holiday release could be a great idea!

Keep an eye out for preorders, and I've already had some enquiries from book bloggers and ARC reviewers, so feel free to get in touch at any time if you'd like to be added to that list. We're nearly there!

In other news, I'm looking at local jobs, overseas jobs and more long-term remote/freelance work, so another round of travel may or may not be in my future. More news on that soon!
