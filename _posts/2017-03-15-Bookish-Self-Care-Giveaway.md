So it's spring, and rainy/snowy depending on your location, and just generally a tough slog. 

Time for a fun bookish/self-care giveaway! There's a gift card to choose some books - Thriftbooks has a range of qualities, so you can splurge for a shiny new edition (US only) or stretch those dollars for a pile of used books. And since I can't send you relaxing booze through the mail, enjoy the next best thing: gin & prosecco themed bath products! Plus a cool old vintage metal and enamel bookmark for whichever books you pick up with your giftcard!

**Small Print (lol):**

This is probably unneccessary, but anyways... Giveaway or commercial accounts are not included in the giveaway. Social Media accounts must be following/friends at the time of giveaway closing. I reserve the right to close any and all giveaways at my discretion. Giveaways are offered by K.A. Wiggins and have no affiliation with Instagram, Facebook, Revue, Github, thriftbooks.com, prize manufacturers, or any other corporation, entity or company. K.A. Wiggins is not responsible for any outcomes related to this giveaway up to and including mail delivery failures and damage to or by giveaway items.

**Note: Earlier "Dreaming of Scotland" giveaway cancelled due to lack of interest; hopefully this one hits the mark better!**
