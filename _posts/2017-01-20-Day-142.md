So itâ€™s not so much that I havenâ€™t been working on this (I have, really, I should be at day like 150+), but itâ€™s been hard going. Sometimes I come up with answers, ideas, inspiration and fixes by ploughing forward, pushing for solutions. But a lot of the time, they come to me sideways. They like to sidle up in my peripheral vision when Iâ€™m not looking in their direction, and then I have to breathe slow and resist the temptation to stare until I can hold on to their afterimage. All that to say, Iâ€™ve spent the majority of the last week or so watching TV, reading books, and building up my IG and Goodreads accounts (yay almost 400!) -and then feeling horribly guilty and panicking for not working hard enough and being behind schedule, and then actually getting a bit of progress in near the end of the day, where I can sleep on it and improve in the morning, until my editor kicks my stuffing out and the cycle starts over.

Yay rewrites.

Just finished The Curiosities. I was up until 4 am last night/this morning with it too. Mad (the crippling kind) brilliant, but also inspiring. Itâ€™s kick-started at least two ideas or writing sessions, and thereâ€™s a sequel that Iâ€™ll start on tonight. The last 5 craptastic books I read were also inspiring, in a different way.

Iâ€™m a little depressed. Iâ€™m a little stuck. Iâ€™m a little anxious. Itâ€™s been raining. I donâ€™t know how to identify feelings (my own) or remember that other people have emotions. Iâ€™m too much like Cole. I donâ€™t understand Cole. I donâ€™t understand storytelling. Iâ€™m a drama queen in a wallflowerâ€™s skin with a berserkerâ€™s heart and a painted mouth.

I feel hopeless and addicted. Iâ€™m not good enough. I can totally do this. I just need to work harder. I just need to hang on. I just need to be somebody different, and itâ€™d all be better.

Iâ€™m a writer. Iâ€™m a teller of stories. Iâ€™m a creator. I exist. The quality of me and mine is a different matter. Which matters. But not as much as I matter.

I think itâ€™s stupid when people say you should write for yourself. Donâ€™t they know all I have to do is turn my gaze inside? Why would I go to the trouble of sorting and pinning and cataloguing ideas for myself when theyâ€™re vital and alive and mercurially bouncing around the space inside? 

I write for myself, to make sense of the ideas and images and thoughts and impressions and sensations that arenâ€™t quite feelings or emotions but something more nebulous. To make of the tangled mess something that resonates for someone else, that tells them theyâ€™re both less special and unique and singular, and more at the same time.

Iâ€™m a living contradiction who believes in absolute truth. Singularity. Trinity. Three in one but not one in three.

Iâ€™ve been reading too much poetry.

Or something. It might be the four hours of sleep last nightâ€¦ or the gin. 

I went outside yesterday. In the dark, behind the locked gates. Trash out, trash in, a tiny golden key, a chore, an escape, an excursion. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll go out today. I probably wonâ€™t.

There are books and deadlines and chores and temptations. I will go out tomorrow.
