#### Background

From September 2017 to March 2018 Blind the Eyes (Threads of Dreams book 1) was queried for representation and receieved multiple full requests. In March 2018, it entered Kindle Scout, but the program was cancelled before its campaign ended and all rights reverted to the author. In June 2018, ebook and paperback editions were produced and sold by the author.

What does that mean?

*Blind the Eyes is a 100% indie title written and produced with independent or hybrid publishing in mind.*

Going indie means operating your own micro-sized publishing company. I had the great fortune to work with awesome professionals on every stage of bringing Blind the Eyes to life. If you're looking for support with your own ventures, I highly recommend every name on this list.
