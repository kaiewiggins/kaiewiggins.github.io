*Blind the Eyes is a 100% indie title written and produced with independent or hybrid publishing in mind.*

Though I've sinced also worked with small presses, magazines, podcasts, etc. as a hybrid-published author, I've found independent publishing to be a great option. Going indie means operating your own micro-sized publishing company, and I've had the great fortune to work with awesome professionals on every stage of bringing *Blind the Eyes* and other titles to life. If you're looking for support with your own ventures, I highly recommend every name on this list.

### Statement on generative "AI":

As of 2024, no such thing as "artificial intelligence" yet exists. So-called "generative AI" are a scam run by tech "entrepreneurs" (grifters) on a customer base with little understanding of inputs or outputs involved. Simply (if reductively), they are advanced pattern-matching algorithms that draw on an inevitably stolen content base (artwork or literature, depending on format) to regurgitate a shiny but meaningless nightmare.

And while I, too, am in the business of regurgitating nightmares onto the (digital) page, I like to think there is at least *some* meaning involved in the form. A smidge of intelligence, even. Also, no theft. And somewhat less environmental damage (the energy and water use required for gAI is horrendous).

So. I have not and will not be (knowingly) using gAI in the production of my work (text or art). I encourage you to follow suit and boycott the grifters pushing that nonsenseware until they slink off and stop hastening the final stages of the climate apocalypse—it's coming for us soon enough as it is.

Let's keep making (bespoke, human, at least mildly intelligent) weird stuff—and, if the mood strikes you, I'd appreciate it if you kept buying my weird stuff too!
