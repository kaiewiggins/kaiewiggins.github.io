## WORD Vancouver Presents: World Read Aloud Day 2023

**Date:** Wednesday, February 1, 2023

**Time:** 10-11am

**Location:** Surrey Library Central City Branch

**Type:** Author Reading & School Presentation

Shoutout to the awesome team at [Word Vancouver](https://wordvancouver.ca/) for the invitation to host their in-person World Read Aloud Day event this year!

I'll be chatting with [CWILL BC](https://www.cwillbc.org/) member and recent debut Emily Seo as she presents a reading from her 2022 middle grade novel *The Science of Boys* and demonstrates some live science.

Local schools will be joining us for this celebration of reading aloud at Surrey Library Central City Branch from 10-11 am on February 1, 2023.

I do also still have availability open on the afternoon of Feb. 1 for schools or libraries who want to book a short, free virtual reading (or, locally, live reading).
