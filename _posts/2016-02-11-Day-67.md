It’s funny; every time I start to feel like this is impossible, like my writing is crap and my storytelling boring, I glance back across a previous section, or read something someone else has done, and go: huh. This could work. It might even be good. 

Here’s hoping! 

In rewrites, I really need to timeline everything and then shuffle the chapters - I wrote initially based off of a sense of appropriateness and urgency that I’m kind of unwilling to let go, but the pacing, although it may read well, is pretty confusing when it comes to timelines, and especially as things go on, I’m feeling the perspective shifts chapter-to-chapter less and less; in most cases, it makes more sense to keep going and raising tension for at least two and up to four chapters. 

Or something. 

Anyway, that’ll be a key issue for the substantive edits/rewriting phase.
