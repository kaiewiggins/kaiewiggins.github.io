Read a blog post by Neil Gaiman on George R.R. Martin, among other things, and was pleasantly surprised at the casual daily-life approach he took. Just like mine, except with first class flights, personal assistants and questions from readers on international celebrities. But other than that, yâ€™know, *so* like mine. Lol.

Webcomics update: currently following [Skin Horse](http://skin-horse.com/), [Questionable Content](http://questionablecontent.net/), Narbonics (Directorâ€™s Cut) & [Sinfest](http://www.sinfest.net/), with occasional catchups on [Gunnerkrig Court](http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/). This is what I spend time on when Iâ€™m not writing, lol. 

Life update: I really need to sort out my meds and figure out what country my healthcare should be inâ€¦ itâ€™s like being 15 again just now. Shitty skin, gross hair, fat â€™n pimply and generally unfit for public. I know itâ€™s all â€˜inâ€™ to be body positive in 2017, but bleagh. Fortunately, I currently hardly have to go out in public; working from the couch in sweatpants and hoodies is totally my speed. Unfortunately, thereâ€™s a family wedding this weekend, so obviously it must be time for my skin to break out like itâ€™s 2003. Hooray. 

In other news, made it through 5 chapters yesterday with more text-level rewrites than Iâ€™d expected, so although that was my minimum targetâ€¦ yay, I made my target! And also spent the morning working on the book map! And the evening doing research and rewriting the same chapters to switch the dream/nightmare monsters to â€˜Maraâ€™, which comes out with a nicer effect. Spent most of the time streamlining language (who am I kidding, itâ€™s still way too wordy, but anyways) and trying to boost the world-building orienting language, which seems clunky to me, but since readers all seem confused as to whatâ€™s going on all. the. time. itâ€™s probably necessary. 

Today I really get into rewriting Ravel for the first time since I wrote his backstory long form, so that should be challenging. So hard to rework existing text without ruining the flow, but the way heâ€™s being portrayed just isnâ€™t working. Today will also hit a bunch of challenging points where information needs to be conveyed without breaking point of view or characterization, so yay. 5 chapters minimum, 10 optimal, 15 ambitious, andâ€¦ go!

Part 2

Well, so much for productivity and exceeding targets today. Decided to go along for a run by the river. Not to actually run, mind you, just as a chance to skip out on work, kill time that I donâ€™t have, collect some allergens and generally shoot myself in the foot. Ate too much for lunch, I guess, or the fresh air knocked me out as I pretty much passed out for the early afternoon. So. Back at it. Iâ€™m running into the usual problem in this stretch, which can be summed up as: communicating information *and* characterization through dialogue is hard. People interact. Itâ€™s confusing and nuanced and not at all straightforward. I feel clever and readers feel confused. *facepalm* So, back at itâ€¦

Part 3

Ugh, so definitely pushing to hit the minimum targets of 5 chapters/day, which probably means Iâ€™m gonna be pulling late nights and scrambling at the end of this period, but assuming I donâ€™t have major mid-stream changes, at least the deadline is still doable.
