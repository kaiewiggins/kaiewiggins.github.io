Oh man, news, news, and more news you guys! I was trying to save it all up to release by newsletter first 'cause I need motivation to keep up with that, but the thing with news is that you're too busy doing newsworthy things to have time to shout about it! ...and THAT doesn't sound arrogant at all, lol. But moving on...

So I got final edits back from the amazing Lisa Poisso, which turned out to be a gracious and generous blend of Substantive and Line Edits 'cause I couldn't make up my mind about what I was asking for. Still some tuning up to do, but overall the manuscript is in amazing shape and I'm already working on the early stages of query materials with her... and then this happened.

Pitchwars. It's a (mostly) Twitter contest to polish and submit your manuscript. In the first round you submit to industry insiders like published authors, editorial assistants etc. If one picks you, you have two months to work with them on refining your book and query materials, and then there's the agent round. If magic happens, you get an agent! At the very least, it's a great way to make connections and learn a ton - which I have. For instance: apparently BLIND THE EYES is Urban Fantasy, not paranormal or horror or dystopian or dark fantasy or all the various other things I've stumbled around thinking it was. Who knew?

Anyways, while it's slowing down my final revisions (though, lol, we all knew they were going to take me longer than I expected because OF COURSE), I'm super excited to be participating in Pitchwars this year and getting BtE in even better shape for publication in whatever form that looks like! So, no newsletter this month, but I'm being hyperactive on Twitter & IG, so go ahead and follow me there instead. :)
