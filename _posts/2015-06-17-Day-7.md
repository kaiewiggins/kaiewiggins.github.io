 and realized once again the iimportance of a good, solid story and likeable characters. It really uses crutches to prop itself up: low, slapstick comedy, absurd trademark speech and characterization, tearjerker death/abandonment issues with no setup and little depth. It was kind of boring, unengaging, trying too hard and without tension. 
 
I'm gonna need to find someonne to push me on the characterization and plot. It seems kind of crazy to have to do all that before even getting an editor, though. I guess you need to have a story established far enough that it stands out from the crowd, but sheesh. 
 
It's tempting to think I can put together a really compelling pitch and bring in an editor early, but on the other hand, don't want to burn through all the good agents by taking a chance on an incomplete manuscript... 
 
Ah the life of a creative; overwhelming hubris and crushing inadequacy~~ 
 
In other news, still tiptoeing around diving into the actual writing of this thing. I think that's more of an at-home, big(ger) chunk of time endeavor, but I could just be being a diva about it too... 
 
Guess I'll keep building out character profiles until the stars align.
