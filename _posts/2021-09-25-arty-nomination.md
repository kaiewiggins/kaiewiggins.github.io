**Original Post: September 9:**

This was a definite higlight of my summer: someone nominated me in the annual [Abbotsford Arts Club Arty Awards](https://abbotsfordartscouncil.com/arty-awards-2/)!

Congrations to my fellow nominees in the literature category, local authors David Tickner, Julia Rohan, Emily Isaacson, and Lauralee S√≠:tel √Å:la Kelly! The awards ceremony will be held remotely on September 25 at 7 pm.
