## B&N Press Presents

I'm super excited to announce that *Blind the Eyes* has been handpicked by the Barnes & Noble Press team for the Summer 2018 B&N Press Presents list!

As a creator, it's always awesome to get a vote of confidence from a respected source like this. *Blind the Eyes* is on a special [sale](http://books2read.com/blindtheeyes) to celebrate, and it's in some great company, so why not head over to [check out the list](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/b/bn-press-presents/teens/_/N-rf4Z19r4) and pick up a few summer reads while you're at it?

Here are a few I'm most excited for:

*Another dystopian fantasy crossover with nightmare monsters–it's this summer's epidemic!* 

Chronopoint was only meant to be a game, but Kiuno finds herself trapped in that world. 

As hideous, twisted monsters only seen in nightmares plague her every move, will she find allies in time or discover death has taken far more than she'd ever imagined? |

### [Stolen Enchantress by Amber Argyle](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/stolen-enchantress-amber-argyle/1128494806?ean=2940159091659)

*A monsters and magic-infused sister story with a fairytale sensibility.*

Any girl who goes into the Forbidden Forest never comes out again. Except the one who did. Beauty and the Beast meets The Pied Piper. 

Larkin should have been watching her sister. She goes after her into the woods and even manages to escape again, but not before discovering the truth lurking beneath the wicked boughs. 

Larkin may have evaded the beast once, but with the full force of his magic now fixated on her, she isn't sure how much longer she can resist.

### [The Illusion Queen by T.E. Dickason](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-illusion-queen-te-dickason/1128768887?ean=2940162047667)

*A dystopian fantasy featuring a brainwashed girl who learns to see past the lies of her homeland and fight for what matters.* 

Aleja is the most celebrated young woman on Corazon, an ancient and mystical island where laws and traditions are carved in stone. 

Every generation one Daughter is chosen to be the Vessel. Aleja accepts the honor willingly–until she discovers her sacrifice only serves a lie that enslaves her people. 

In order to survive, Aleja must reject the world she thought she knew and learn that even rules in stone can be broken.
