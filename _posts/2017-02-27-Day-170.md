So every night Iâ€™m like; ok, so tomorrow Iâ€™ll just sit down and get right to work early and get in a crazy amount and totally rock this rewrite and finish earlyâ€¦ and then itâ€™s midafternoon and I finally force myself to get startedâ€¦

lol. In other news, I think Iâ€™m a definite late-in-the-day/night-writer. 

Finally got to work on pulling together and photographing my giveaways, though Iâ€™m not entirely happy with the results. Made some custom corner book marks b/c I was wasting way too much time surfing Etsy and trying to find some good ones that would ship in a reasonable amount of time and also match my themes. The results arenâ€™t epic, but theyâ€™re not absolutely terrible, so I feel like thatâ€™s a win, and actually, the packages are better than I expected once I got them all together. Now I just have to finish pulling together my FB page, making custom graphics for it and my website, sort out some rules and get this show on the road.

Ugh, graphics. So thatâ€™s going to take forever and still be unsatisfyingâ€¦ So maybe Iâ€™ll just dive in and get my writing done first and keep procrastinating on that oneâ€¦ 

I also need to do another spin through the plot and refine the updated plan so I can (hopefully) speed through the rewrites-to-date and adjust for what the ending necessitates. And I should really take the day off tomorrow and go in to Van to catch up with friends and see baby Jasper, but then Iâ€™d have to get my FotC serial chapter done todayâ€¦ and I should get on with booking flights and trip planning, soâ€¦ Yeah, I think Iâ€™ll just write and pretend none of that other stuff is happening! :)

So. Hard. To. Focus. Also, thanks a lot to the guy who posted giant Australian spiders to IG. I appreciate the reminder that I never want to go to Australia.
