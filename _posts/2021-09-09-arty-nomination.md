This was a definite higlight of my summer: someone nominated me in the annual [Abbotsford Arts Club Arty Awards](https://abbotsfordartscouncil.com/arty-awards-2/)!

Congrations to my fellow nominees in the literature category, local authors David Tickner, Julia Rohan, Emily Isaacson, and Lauralee Sí:tel Á:la Kelly! The awards ceremony will be held remotely on September 25 at 7 pm.

If you're a visiting and looking to check out my work in hardcopy, you can find paperbacks locally to borrow through the [Fraser Valley Regional Library](https://fvrl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1776036021), or for sale at [The Bookman](https://www.bookman.ca/) or [Hemingways Books and Records](http://www.hemibooks.com/). Thanks for reading and shopping local!
