Man, I always forget how much time chores take up. Spent yesterday voting, cooking, doing dishes, laundry, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming, going to the store, the library, doing more dishesâ€¦ I mean, yes I was having a hard time sitting down and focusing, but still! Iâ€™d even cooked and done laundry on the weekend, so it wasnâ€™t like the chores had all stacked up or anything!

I guess I just like to increasing the pressure and anxiety by putting off the things that really need doing like, I dunno, finishing this book and doing freelancing, lol.

Anyways, still stuck in backstory-land, but hoping to actually get down to work on the plot in the book map today. My working plan is to get the structure set as of this week (and polish off the last couple outstanding freelance assignments), and then have the remaining three weeks for rewritesâ€¦ which is not a lot of time, but meh, hereâ€™s hoping. 

On the plus side, one of the two complete audiobooks is approved for sale and being set up on Amazon, Audible and iTunes, while the other just came back yesterday with the same feedback as the first (boost average volume), and Iâ€™ve finished that correction and sent it out, so those wonâ€™t be hanging over me, ready to clamour for attention at some inopportune, deadline-approaching time. Also sent out three more auditions, for both flat-fee and royalty-share opportunities, so Iâ€™m free from recording requirements for a few weeks at least, unless I get on with recording a sample from BtEâ€¦ which I really should do, as someone else signed up for my mailing list and I should actually start promoting and sending messages to those folks, lol. 

Part 2

So I think Iâ€™ve got backstory and plot done for the Maria/Ravel angle with hints at Cole & family historyâ€¦ gonna take a stab at some more detailed backstory for Itri - who really ought to be renamed - because he really needs some more depth too, and then hopefully get on to stitching the plot book map back together today. Hereâ€™s hoping!
