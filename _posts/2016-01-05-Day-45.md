So. 

Christmas is over, New Years is past. Passed? Whatever. My head hurts (unrelated). 

2016: the year of the novel. 

By the end of this year (well, hopefully, by the end of the first quarter of the year!) at least one novel will be finished (first draft, anyways). I’ll settle for forward motion, but I’d like to get some speed up. 

One scheme involves going to my parent’s office at least one (or a couple?) days a week to sit in an empty room and get a full day of writing in. 

I’m not sure it’s possible, but it sounds good, right? 

Another scheme involves running two or more projects at the same time, maybe one as a serial for immediate online release. I have most of a fantasy/time-and-dimension travel YA novel done that could be edited for quick release, another kids fairy fantasy with some progress that could go out, and I’d like to work on a historical fiction-fantasy (/romance??) too… 

Again, not sure if it’s possible, but in that vein, I’m going to push to get through the contract work I have to clear the deck for these projects. At the 50K word mark (of this project), I’ll start building the online presence, and potentially launch the serial, quick-release projects as part of the platform building efforts. 

Off to the races!
