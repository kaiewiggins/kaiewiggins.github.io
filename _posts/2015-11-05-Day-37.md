So a bit stuck again; did some work on upcoming plot developments that should shape the next 1-4 chapters and also a bit of rewriting to repurpose an initial bit character (Morris2), rather than having to introduce even more named characters - there’s at least 3 more coming up in the next few chapters, and the cast is already huge, so… 

Plot is surprisingly on target considering how freeform I’ve been with writing - there may actually be a passing resemblance by the time I’m done. Wild. 

In other news, still obsessed with history and genealogy research, so that’s eating up lots of time. I’ve got a fair bit of chores and side work that I’ve been ignoring and that I should really clean up for general peace of mind and stress reduction, so I’ll dive into that next…
