So, lot's of big stuff going on:

After a few awesome days in London (Camden Blues Kitchen - check it out!), I'm officially back in BC for Christmas... and a couple months thereafter. 

The first high-level edit of Blind the Eyes is in. I've read it and put it away for about a week to... process. Yes, rewrites will be significant - and need to be done for March. The short version is that I'm a better writer than I am storyteller, and it's a weird little story that breaks all the rules and needs some big shifts to conform. Which I should make it do, but don't quite know how to without losing things I'm not willing to give up on. Like a protagonist that lacks motivation. Lol... So that'll be interesting.

But in the meantime, I've been working on a couple other writing projects. I'm hoping to use web fiction/serialized writing platforms like Wattpad and Jukepop to get a better sense of what connects with readers, build a following and eventually market Blind the Eyes, while at the same time just getting in some more practice at different ways of storytelling. Providing free, value-added content is a major marketing move in self publishing these days, so I'm hoping to dovetail that somehow.

So far, I've got two chapters each of Flame of the Connarii and Things get out of Hand. FotC actually has a full draft that I wrote as a teen and uni student. It's terrible, of course, WAY too much sermonizing speeches, but there's a full cast, a hack-job of a plot and everything. So I'm editing and rewriting that on a chapter-by-chapter basis for Tuesday each week, hoping it'll come out to something reasonable. At the same time, I'm dealing with my disappointment with the directions things went in Blind the Eyes by relaunching the original story behind the novel and trying to take it in a closer direction to what I originally intended. TgooH is kind of a snarky romance with supernatural stuff in the background (so far), and is a true serial, written day-of for Friday releases. 

Of course, what I really need to do is sit down and plot out exciting scenes and character motiviations. Lol. Maybe one day.

Thinking about a significant website overhaul to zero in on the writing more, since that's the only thing I've been keeping up with. That, or I really need to write a bunch of blogs on all the travel... But I've got to dive in to the rewrites for real next week, so we'll see if any of that actually gets done...
