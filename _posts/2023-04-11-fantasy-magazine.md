Incredibly proud and excited to share "Children of Earth" with the world. 🎉

Eco-anxiety takes on a life of its own 😏 in this laugh-out-loud climate fiction-meets-body horror-meets-rom com about the dangers of lusting after your neighbour('s laneway house) & the pursuit of eco-sainthood in Issue 90 (April 2023) of Fantasy Magazine.

It features a goblin-mode Millennial, toenail cryptids, and a shared compost bin.

You can [read it (or listen to the podcast/audiobook version) for free online](https://www.fantasy-magazine.com/fm/fiction/children-of-earth/), [buy the whole brilliant💅 April edition as an ebook for just $2.99](https://www.fantasy-magazine.com/april-2023-issue-90/), or [subscribe for even more fantastic speculative lit for under $24/year](https://www.fantasy-magazine.com/subscribe/)!

And don't miss my [author spotlight](https://www.fantasy-magazine.com/fm/non-fiction/author-spotlights/author-spotlight-k-a-wiggins/) with Fantasy Magazine co-editor-in-chief Christie Yant while you're there.

Podcast/audiobook version narrated by Judy Young. Longlisted in the 2023 Commonwealth Short Story Prize. Honourable Mention in the 2022 Writers of the Future Awards.

With thanks to Arley Sorg at Fantasy Magazine for hands-down the best editing experience I've ever had, Dean Wesley Smith at WMG Publishing/Pulphouse Fiction Magazine for the killer workshop that spawned this monstrosity, and Rebecca Schaeffer's MARKET OF MONSTERS series for the twisted inspo (& Mirella's name).

And it's kinda a deep cut, but for anyone who's curious (mild spoiler alert? IDK?🤷), the thing Mirella orders to deal with her little problem was totally inspired by a Lomi machine, so if you guessed that, congrats. 😂
