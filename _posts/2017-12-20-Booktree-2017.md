Microupdate plus #booktree end of year shout outs to everyone who's sent me books this year!

Where things are at: 

- Blind the Eyes (G&S book 1) is *still* under query, so the tentative indie release date has been bumped to March 2018. There's been some good feedback and it may still get picked up by tradpub, thus the long runway. :)

- G&S2 plot is mapped out and undergoes developmental consultation on Jan. 10, so hopefully I'll be at least mid-draft by the time book 1 comes out! Currently expecting G&S will be a trilogy.

- Serial fiction Things Got Out of Hand is finally getting a proper plot map! I haven't decided whether to continue its draft zero as a serial or take it down yet, so keep an eye on Wattpad in the new year just in case :)

- Tiptoeing into some short story writing, since the serials are necessarily on hold for a while yet. The zero drafts need some polishing, but expect some short reads in the new year in a wider variety of genres (I tried for contemporary, but so far I can't help sneaking in some fantasy or supernatural elements into every story)

- Been rounding out my freelance portfolio and recently launched [Business Writing Solutions](http://www.businesswriting.solutions) in beta on the boring grown-up side of my life. The part of me that isn't compelled to write about monsters and magic tends to geek out over template automation and well-crafted copy, lol.

- Still in the Pacific Northwest for the foreseeable future. Travel's on the radar, but there're just too many bullet points to tick off to make #digitalnomad-ing practical right now!

So! On to the shout-outs. Special thanks to [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/giveaway), [49th Shelf](https://49thshelf.com) and artist & book blogger [Iryna Khymych](https://twitter.com/IrynaKhymych) who have taken the trouble and expense to send me books this year!

As promised in the social media posts that you probably followed to get here, here's the full list of books with review and shopping links.
