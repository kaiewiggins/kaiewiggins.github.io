I often get asked where readers can find my books, so I keep a running list of bookstores with copies in stock and library networks with lending copies here.

Online shopping options are linked from each title on the Threads of Dreams and Standalones pages.

(With apologies to those who struggle with reading off a screen, it's usually not feasible to create print versions of the shorter fiction unless they sell as part of an anthology.)

If you're a library or bookseller interested in carrying one of my paperbacks or hardcovers, feel free to get in touch or reference the linked cut sheets for the relevant work:
