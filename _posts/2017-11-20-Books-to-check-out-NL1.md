*This edition of book recommendations first appeared in Newsletter June 2017 edition*

###Best of the Best:

- *[Strange the Dreamer by Laini Taylor:](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1874917240) you need to read this. Seriously. Beautiful writing. Gorgeous language. Classic, epic storytelling. The richest worldbuilding you can imagine.

- *[Three Dark Crowns by Kendare Blake](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1922833230)* best YA dark fantasy all year. Three competing protagonists with their own cast and setting. Plus, Kendare's one of my fave writers who inspired the style and content of Blind the Eyes. PNW writers unite!

- *[A Court of Thorns and Roses by Sarah J. Maas:](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1877354261)* and the sequel is even better, an incredible accomplishment when most second books are the weakest of a trilogy. Mature content warning.


###Canadian reads to check out:

- *[Exit, Pursued by a Bear by E.K. Johnston:](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1971454999)* a strangely uplifting tale of teen rape. Non-explicit trigger warning for trauma, but an incredibly hopeful and instructive read of how to help in the aftermath, and how stepping in changes everything.

- *[Missing by Kelley Armstrong:](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2022816960)* best YA thriller I've read in ages (well, since the last one she wrote, probably, lol.)Â Just the right balance of compelling romance between complex, relatable and flawed people in a high-stakes fast-paced setting.
