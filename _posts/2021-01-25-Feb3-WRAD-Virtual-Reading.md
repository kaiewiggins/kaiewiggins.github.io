## World Read Aloud Day Online

**Date:** February 3, 2021

**Time:** 9am - 8pm PST

**Location:** your classroom, library, or book club via Zoom (or similar)

**Type:** Live Reading 

[World Read Aloud Day](https://www.litworld.org/worldreadaloudday) is a "celebration of the power of reading aloud to create community, to amplify new stories, and to advocate for literacy as a foundational human right."

As creators of books for young readers, many members of [CWILL BC](https://cwillbc.org) are offering free 10-20 min. virtual readings in support of this wonderful cause.

While I'm more than happy to present to classrooms, library groups or book clubs of all ages, my fiction currently targets ages 14+, so for elementary or middle school groups I will instead be reading from an age-appropriate Canadian children's book that inspires me. 

Shoot me a message at [kaiewrites@gmail.com](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) to book a free 10-20 minute reading + author visit on February 3, 2021!
