So last week was a little crazy. CBC news caught onto a situation that's been developing in the publishing world. The tl;dr is that a combination of pandemic and shipping-related issues is making books more expensive and making it hard to stock and nearly impossible to restock physical copies of books on any kind of reasonable timeline.

Spent a few days on correspondence, recorded [print/blog](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-writers-publishers-fear-supply-chain-issues-as-holiday-season-approaches-1.6189109) & tv interviews and a [live radio](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/1953164867823) piece on behalf of CWILL BC members. Decided it might be clearer to just lay things out in my own words. If you want the deep dive, it's posted over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@kaie.web/still-reading-gifting-paper-books-why-that-might-be-a-problem-this-year-c7a0a2105d82).

The upshot of all this is that it gave us the kick in the pants we needed to finally launch our (CWILL BC) planned giveaway!
