So, after ten+ minutes trying to set up the commemorative selfie, I have sealed my fate. It’s happening. THE END. Today. 

It’s really more of an epilogue. Or whatever. But it’s the last scoped-out section of writing before I dive into rewrites, and as it happens, I magically acquired another day of solo, couch-sitting, PJ-wearing working space - and the landscapers have even stopped buzzing away outside. 

So for reals, it’s time to make this happen. 


Monday
