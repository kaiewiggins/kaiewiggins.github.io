If you're a book blogger, reviewer, or bookstagrammer, first of all, you rock & I wish I could take photos even half as well as you. :D


## Review Policy

I believe reviews are for readers, not authors! Beta reading is where readers give comments directly to the author on a draft version of a book and you can [apply to beta read](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) if that's something you want to explore.

While I sometimes come across reviews in the course of my work or when looking for useful blurbs/ad-copy, it's very important that you feel comfortable leaving an honest, unbiased review. I don't read all my reviews, and I never follow-up on them unless specifically tagged for comment.

Social (Instagram, mostly) and blog posts will probably get a like/repost/boost/comment if I'm tagged, but I will never follow up on a negative review.

The best time to request a review copy (/ARC) is up to two months before an upcoming new release, but I will consider all review copy requests and can add you to a list of interested reviewers at any time. A larger number of ebook review copies will be available compared to paperback, given cost, time, and technical constraints, but paperback ARCs are occasionally available.

If you would like to review one of my books, please [email](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) the details of your blog or other online presence and the book and format you are requesting. 

I use BookSprout to coordinate pre-release ARCs, and you can also [follow me there](https://booksprout.co/author/2405/k-a-wiggins) to get an automatic notification whenever a new review edition is available.

I welcome bloggers and reviewers from all countries; however, the ability to read and communicate in written English is a necessary requirement. (Reviewers interested in my translated works should contact the publisher directly to enquire about a review copy.)
