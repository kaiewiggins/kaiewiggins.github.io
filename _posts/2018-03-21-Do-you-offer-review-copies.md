If you're a book blogger, reviewer, or bookstagrammer, first of all, you rock & I wish I could take photos even half as well as you. :D

Please [email](mailto:kaiewrites@gmail.com) the details of your blog or other online presence and the book and format you are requesting. 

I use BookSprout to coordinate pre-release ARCs, and you can also [follow me there](https://booksprout.co/author/2405/k-a-wiggins) to get an automatic notification whenever a new review edition is available.

I welcome bloggers and reviewers from all countries; however, the ability to read and communicate in written English is a necessary requirement.
