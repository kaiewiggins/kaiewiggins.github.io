Welcome to kaie.Space
</h1>
<div>
  Things coming soon: 
  <ul>
  <li>color!</li>
  <li>menus!</li>
  <li>structure in general so your eyes don't bleed!</li>
  <li>graphics (aka: my shitty iPhoto photography)</li>
  <li>blog (hopefully using a Medium API)</li>
  <li>journal (no, this is not the same... well, not *exactly* the same)</li>
  <li>writing stuff! Short fiction and excerpts from my upcoming book... and one day, ebook links!</li>
  <li>beta readers sign-up. Please help.</li>
  <li>reading list (hopefully using a Goodreads API)</li>
  <li>other awesome stuff lists - writing, business and more</li>
  <li>social media - because of course</li>
  <li>newsletter sign-up, because sometimes people that buy books are too cool for social media (but still use gmail...)</li>
  <li>consulting services... because grown-up stuff</li>
  <li>...and! Teaser! Publishing stuff, because I have friends with stuff to say. And I have no sense of self-preservation! Shoot me an email if you have name ideas; I'm stuck...</li>
  <li>user-contribution area (sadly empty)</li>
  <li>anything else awesome that I feel the need to add! Note: this will probably involve candid shots of my cats. Just a heads-up.</li>
  </ul>
  ...I'll try to keep things moving along here, but in the meantime, feel free to shoot me a <a href="kaie.web@gmail.com">message</a>.
